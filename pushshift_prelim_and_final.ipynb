       " 'selftext': \"When I was fresh out of Uni I was finding it difficult to find a job with my new degree due to my lack of experience on the level of employment I was looking for. After moving to a new area to be closer to family, I sent out a flurry of applications for the less skilled work I had done while going to school (and thus had a lot of experience in). These positions were still in the field of my degree, just on a lower level. I immediately had several interviews lined up and ended up taking a position in a company that was close to my home and seemed to have opportunities for professional growth in my chosen field.\\n\\nUpon starting my new job it immediately became obvious that there was a core group of 6-8 women who were very cliquey and, as it turned out, would  sometimes be bullies toward those not in the 'in crowd'. The first few days they were nice enough - not warm, mind you, but professional, at least. I figure they were feeling me out to see what kind of person I am. \\n\\nThen one day came 'the test'. I don't remember the exact details because this was about 8 years ago, but one of them said something intentionally abrasive and insulting to me, presumably to gauge my reaction. I remained calm, as always, and basically just gave s**t right back to her, in a tone and manner that was not confrontational but firm, letting them all know I was not the easy mark they were looking for. They made a couple more weak attempts to get under my skin, but couldn't get the reaction they were hoping for, so eventually they mostly ignored me. \\n\\nAs my time in the department was approaching the one year mark I began looking for a better position, and soon found one in the same company that was more in line with my career goals. It paid better and I didn't have to see any of the 'mean girls' ever again, which was a bonus. After working at this new level for another year, this time in a management position, things were going really well. But I knew I now had more bargaining leverage after a year of management experience, and began looking for an even higher position elsewhere. It wasn't long before I was offered and accepted a job at a rival company that paid about 2/3 more than I had been making and also represented an upward move in my career. \\n\\nRoughly two years later I was interviewing applicants for a couple of openings in my department. My assistant called the next interviewee in, and guess who walked in to try and get a job under me. Not only one of the 'mean girls', but one of the worst of the bad bunch. I had witnessed her and her friends run off at least two other employees at my old position, and there was no way in hello I was going to invite that kind of poison into my department. \\n\\nThe look on her face when she saw me was priceless, and inside I was smirking! But on the outside, I expressed surprise to see her (I actually was. Interviews were set up by our HR department along with my assistant). I greeted her warmly, like an old friend, and she visibly relaxed. We chatted a bit and I learned that our old department had been outsourced, and the clique had been split up. Turns out my old 'friend' was not happy with the new position she had been forced into and had actually quit without having another job lined up. I got the impression she was badly in need of a new job. \\n\\nSmiling and still treating her like an old friend, I told her we would be in touch in a manner that insinuated that she was a shoo-in for one of the openings I had. As soon as she was out the door, her resume and application went right into the waste bin.\\n\\nI had all but forgotten her when I got a call about a week and a half later. She was inquiring as to whether I had made a decision yet. Still being warm and friendly (which is actually my nature) I apologized and told her we had actually hired two people who had more experience, but if it was ok with her I would keep her resume and if anything else came up I would call her. \\n\\nI spent the rest of the day with a slight spring in my step and I couldn't wipe the smile off my face. I never saw any of them again, so with this being a smallish industry I'm assuming she told her other cronies what happened, because no one else from their clique ever darkened my doorstep again.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Back in the 2010’s I was living in Louisiana and going to school. I got a job at a daycare with the understanding I was training to be the assistant manager, then later the manager. They had a really high rate of turnover for a daycare, they just couldn’t keep employees and didn’t know why. I have a lot of experience and training in childcare and have done a lot of managerial work within the field, like maintaining supplies, creating lesson plans and activities, checking time sheets, processing payments, etc. The owner was looking to hand over a lot of the day-to-day business, so that’s where I was supposed to come in. \\n\\nThe daycare that hired me was situated between the campus and my apartment, so it was also a convenient location. I could go to and from school to work, and vice versa. It seemed like it was going to be a decent place to work. I had the one year olds and I loved them to bits. It was easy to slip in the routine with the other teachers and the kids I had took to me very quickly. About a week in I ask about the training and my boss tells me I need to hit sixty days first. Okay, no biggie. They want to make sure I’ll stick around and not just use them for training/certs. So, I make it through the probationary period and there’s still no mention of training. The room with the older kids always smelled like pee, but when I brought it up they just dismissed it as a kid who had problems wetting himself. All the time, apparently. The two year old teacher was always on her phone playing games, the kids would run wild the entire time while she sat with her head down, not watching them. I brought that up, as well, and was told it wasn’t my business. The infant teacher was the only one that actually seemed to care and be invested in the kids, at all. \\n\\nAs much as that bothered me it was also stuff I knew I could fix because I had done it before at other places. If we could ever get to the actual fucking training, that is. I get only vague answers when I ask my boss about it, and it’s really starting to irk the furk out of me. I was  also getting REALLY GD tired of listening to my boss talk about the kids or their parents, calling one mom a slut because of how she dressed, or saying how weird this little boy in my room was. My room also shared a half wall with the kitchen, so when my boss was back there prepping breakfast or lunch I could hear everything she said. She was a newly single 55 yr old divorcee who’d just started to go out to clubs and drink again and pick up men. There’s nothing wrong with that, I mean get it, girl! More power to ya, but please stop talking about shaving your bombass cooch around my kids. She did this ALL THE TIME, on the phone, to other teachers, even parents, like they wanted to hear about the grown and sexy club she found last night or how she’s walking crooked from pulling a muscle in her crotch. \\n\\nI stuck it out thinking, “Okay, I can do this, she’ll be gone most of the time anyway when I take over and I can implement some changes so she’s not running people off with her attitude.” So, one day I have a little boy (the same one she often tried to say was weird) who starts running a fever and has to go home. I call his parents and they tell me his grandparents are heading over to pick him up. He’s a very quiet little boy, never makes any waves or anything. His parents are absolutely precious. His grandparents come in and are just as sweet. So, they come in my classroom while my boss is preparing lunch. She’s talking to another teacher while I talk to the grandparents about his symptoms. All of a sudden we hear her talking about the little boy, how he stunk and ‘what else do you expect from ragheads?’. I am stuck somewhere between absolutely mortified and thoroughly goddamn enraged, but I also have a bunch of little kids volleying for my attention and don’t want to scare them. I clear my throat as loudly as humanly fucking possible, but She. Keeps. Going, talking about the parents and how she was glad she didn’t have to deal with them right now, because somebody else was picking him up. I’m apologizing profusely to the grandparents at this point. I peak my head around the corner and tell her to shut up, then watch the couple leave with their grandson. \\n\\nShe comes out of the kitchen and says nothing at all, just walks straight by without a word. I get the kids to sleep, then go on my lunch break. Just as I return, I hear her on the phone in the office as soon as I walk in. She is telling the boy’s parents that I was the one in the kitchen talking about him, blaming every disgusting thing she said on me. Of all the nerve, the outright unmitigated gall, WHO tf does that?! I was heated.\\n\\nI waited until the end of the day, walked in her office, and quit on the spot. I then reported a lot of the infractions and stuff I had seen that she never corrected, even though she was fully aware of the issues. Didn’t think about her again, until six months later....\\n\\nI’m pulling through the Jack In the Box drive-thru and I hear a familiar voice on the speaker. Nah, I think, can’t be. I pull around and there my former boss is standing in the window wearing a drive-thru headset. This was funny for two reasons: 1) when I left she wished me luck flipping burgers (in return I wished her luck keeping the place afloat) and 2) she treated service people like absolute shit. Not enough ice in her drink? She’d call and complain. They forgot extra ketchup? Well, then she deserved free fucking food. Just an absolute Karen any time she had the chance.\\n\\nI stop at the window and stare for a second. She looks straight through me at first. I gave her the money and said,  “Fancy meeting you here.” \\n\\nShe never acknowledged me, but she did throw my change, coins included, at me in my truck, then asked, “Will that be all?”\\n\\nYep, honey, I’m going to feast on this moment for years.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Background: I (m, 23)still live together with my sister(18) and my mum. Since I\\'m still in university, and all classes are online anyway, I\\'m pretty much stuck at home 24/7. My mum is an essential worker, and my sister goes to high school, which takes place in person. The relationship between my sister and I is frosty at best. \\n\\nThis happened today: I woke up, followed my morning routine, and was preparing for my first class, when my mum bursts into my room. I could immediately see that she was pissed! She asks: \"do you have diarrhoea?\". I was completely caught off guard. \"What?!?\" - \"Do you have diarrhoea?!\" she asks again, more angrily this time. I replied: \"no, why do you mean? What\\'s going on?\". She is somehow even more pissed. \"Come with me!\". She then led me to the restroom, and proceeded to show me the toilet. It looked like it was struck my a meteor shower; there were traces of poo everywhere! I can clearly see why she is disgusted and upset, but I\\'m certain that I didn\\'t do it. Judging by her mood I\\'d bet all my money that she didn\\'t do it either. She then repeated this spiel with my sister, who reacted similarly. I can clearly see that my mum has reached a point where the last bit of rationality has left her judgement, which happens quite frequently. \"I don\\'t care who this was, but when I come home from work this toilet will better be sparkling clean! No discussion!\". She went to work directly after finishing her instructions. I thought that my sister should have felt responsible to clean up her mess, and walked back into my room, because my class is about to start. Big mistake! A few minutes later my sister opened my door, and told me, with the biggest grin on her face: \"I\\'m off to high school, I\\'ll be home late, so have fun cleaning!\". So she is smiling and smirking, smug as can be, and closed the door behind her.\\n\\nOkay, now I was pissed. Not only did she almost gave my mum a heart attack, but she also decided that I could clean up her diarrhoea?! The class started at this point, but I couldn\\'t focus. It was more like a radio, running in the background. The only thing on my mind was revenge!\\n\\nI didn\\'t have another choice than to clean everything in the end. I didn\\'t have too much of a problem with that tbh. I just took an old rag, some soap, and whiped everything clean. Took me 2 minutes max.\\n\\nCue petty revenge: now, please don\\'t think that my sister got away scot free just because I did her duty. Remember the old rag I mentioned? Well, after cleaning I took said rag and went into her room. I then carefully whiped this rag across her pillow, turned her pillow and whiped again. I of course paid attention that nobody could SEE that I did this, and there were no actual poo stains. But it is so satisfying that, for the next few days, she placed her head in her own mess, and slept in her actual sh*t. She must have felt the same when she had someone cleaning after her. I guess this counts as a win win situation, right?\\n\\nTL;DR: my sister wants me to clean her diarrhoea, I\\'ll make her sleep in it',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"When I was fresh out of Uni I was finding it difficult to find a job with my new degree due to my lack of experience on the level of employment I was looking for. After moving to a new area to be closer to family, I sent out a flurry of applications for the less skilled work I had done while going to school (and thus had a lot of experience in). These positions were still in the field of my degree, just on a lower level. I immediately had several interviews lined up and ended up taking a position in a company that was close to my home and seemed to have opportunities for professional growth in my chosen field.\\n\\nUpon starting my new job it immediately became obvious that there was a core group of 6-8 women who were very cliquey and, as it turned out, would  sometimes be bullies toward those not in the 'in crowd'. The first few days they were nice enough - not warm, mind you, but professional, at least. I figure they were feeling me out to see what kind of person I am. \\n\\nThen one day came 'the test'. I don't remember the exact details because this was about 8 years ago, but one of them said something intentionally abrasive and insulting to me, presumably to gauge my reaction. I remained calm, as always, and basically just gave s**t right back to her, in a tone and manner that was not confrontational but firm, letting them all know I was not the easy mark they were looking for. They made a couple more weak attempts to get under my skin, but couldn't get the reaction they were hoping for, so eventually they mostly ignored me. \\n\\nAs my time in the department was approaching the one year mark I began looking for a better position, and soon found one in the same company that was more in line with my career goals. It paid better and I didn't have to see any of the 'mean girls' ever again, which was a bonus. After working at this new level for another year, this time in a management position, things were going really well. But I knew I now had more bargaining leverage after a year of management experience, and began looking for an even higher position elsewhere. It wasn't long before I was offered and accepted a job at a rival company that paid about 2/3 more than I had been making and also represented an upward move in my career. \\n\\nRoughly two years later I was interviewing applicants for a couple of openings in my department. My assistant called the next interviewee in, and guess who walked in to try and get a job under me. Not only one of the 'mean girls', but one of the worst of the bad bunch. I had witnessed her and her friends run off at least two other employees at my old position, and there was no way in hello I was going to invite that kind of poison into my department. \\n\\nThe look on her face when she saw me was priceless, and inside I was smirking! But on the outside, I expressed surprise to see her (I actually was. Interviews were set up by our HR department along with my assistant). I greeted her warmly, like an old friend, and she visibly relaxed. We chatted a bit and I learned that our old department had been outsourced, and the clique had been split up. Turns out my old 'friend' was not happy with the new position she had been forced into and had actually quit without having another job lined up. I got the impression she was badly in need of a new job. \\n\\nSmiling and still treating her like an old friend, I told her we would be in touch in a manner that insinuated that she was a shoo-in for one of the openings I had. As soon as she was out the door, her resume and application went right into the waste bin.\\n\\nI had all but forgotten her when I got a call about a week and a half later. She was inquiring as to whether I had made a decision yet. Still being warm and friendly (which is actually my nature) I apologized and told her we had actually hired two people who had more experience, but if it was ok with her I would keep her resume and if anything else came up I would call her. \\n\\nI spent the rest of the day with a slight spring in my step and I couldn't wipe the smile off my face. I never saw any of them again, so with this being a smallish industry I'm assuming she told her other cronies what happened, because no one else from their clique ever darkened my doorstep again.\",\n",

The particular class was one that had periodic \"tests\" in tutorial that counted towards your grade, but you worked in groups of two or three to complete them.\\n\\nSo far I had been doing pretty well in this class and did a reasonable amount of study before the tests as they were closed book and worth a significant portion of our grade. Everyone who is in this tutorial usually sits in similar spots every week and I usually was beside this one guys who was notoriously useless when it came to contributing to anything. He made no attempt to hide his uselessness and would often proudly announce how little (zero) study he had done for tests. He did however, know that I did prepare, so would always make himself a part of my group when it came to tests so he would get the good mark without having to contribute anything. While at first I didn\\'t really give a fuck, it slowly started getting on my nerves until one day in lecture before the tutorial he would not stfu about how little he had done to prepare for the test. \\n\\nSo after lecture I literally *ran* to tutorial to get there before him and quickly formed a group of three with whoever was already there. When he arrived he tried his best to weasel his way into our group saying we could just do a group of four until the TA shut him down and paired him with the other most useless kid in the class. The way his face fell and he babbled as he was trying to get out of the situation, and when he realized he was going to fail was so delicious.

       "  'selftext': \"So this happen to me back when I was in high school a couple of years ago. My family is Cuban but I was born and raised in America, I am fluent in both Spanish and English. I easily pass as a white guy (expect I have extremely hispanic name) and I rarely ever speak Spanish outside of my house.\\n\\nSo my freshman year in high school back in 2012 the bus stop was a five to ten minute walk from my house and I live in Florida so the whether was either raining or blistering heat. I had a friend who lived a couple houses away and his mom was a stay at home mom (we can call her Karen). So Karen would drive us both to the bus stop or sometimes all the way to school. Karen was a super religious type she would only play christian music and was the type that thought Pokemon was made by the devil and basically everything pop culture was too. Neither Karen or her son knew I spoke Spanish. So for the three years she drove me to school she would would talk shit about me to her son in Spanish. She basically would judge my outfit, say racist things, call me dumb, make fun of my haircut, and anything else about me she did not like. When Karen spoke to me in english she would acted like the nicest lady you ever met. I pretended I did not understand her for three years because screw walking. I knew that senior year I would be driving myself to school so the last day of Junior year when she gave me a ride to school we had the following conversation in Spanish.\\n\\nop: Good morning Karen\\n\\nKaren: good morning (in a confused tone)\\n\\nop: since today is the last you will have to drive me to school. I just want to let you know how grateful I was for you driving me to school these past three year. So my mom made you chocolate tres leches you son told me it was your favorite.\\n\\nKaren: (in surprised Pikachu face) YoU sPeAk SpAnIsh?!?\\n\\nop: yes, ofc that all my family speaks at home. Your jokes about me the last few years have been hilarious.\\n\\nKaren: You should have told me you spoke Spanish you invade my private conversations with my son!\\n\\nmeanwhile at this point karen son starts busting out laughing, Karen then starts to slap her son\\n\\nKaren: YOU BOTH CAN WALK TO SCHOOL GTFO OF MY CAR NOW!!! AND TAKE YOUR STUPID CAKE WITH YOU!!\\n\\nop: okay have a good rest of your day Karen. Thank you again.\\n\\nMy friend apologized for his mom's behavior but idc and we both just laugh. I did appreciate the rides and I have thick enough skin to not care what she said about me. I never saw Karen again and last I heard her son and her are not on speaking terms.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Short and sweet.\\n\\nI am known to purchase the giant jar of JellyBelly from Costco. Very reasonable price. I don\\'t mind people coming in and shaking out a handful, but when somebody who badmouths me behind my back, always wants in on lunch runs but always promises to get us next time and therefore never actually pays comes in and takes a whole mug full without asking permission - or even saying hi - and makes it clear that she hates me but loves the JellyBelly supply I had to take action.\\n\\nWe are both early morning people, so there is usually an hour, hour and a half with nobody but the two of us in the office, so I knew there would be no innocent victims.\\n\\nYou can buy a box of the JellyBelly game - it contains an assortment of beans that come in identical pairs, one has a good flavor and one flavor is horrible: is that bean coconut or rotten eggs? Will you get soap, earthworm, booger, dishwater or booger? In the game you spin a spinner and eat whatever color it tells you to eat and you have a 50/50 chance of getting a good flavor or a nasty one. Actually a fun game. Among friends.\\n\\nHowever, this did not involve a friend. So I happily bought a box of the nasty mix and dumped it into the jar. There were only 1-2\" left in the bottom so this was a sacrifice I was willing to make. And then I waited.\\n\\nI left my office for a bit, came back and saw that there were significantly fewer beans left. Perfect.\\n\\nAbout ten minutes later I heard a wonderful cacophony of gagging, retching and utterances of disgust, accompanied by what sounded suspiciously like something being spit into the trash can down the hall. With said trash can having a hint of a whiff of rotten egg. With a cup of uneaten JellyBelly added to the top of the trash.\\n\\nThe remainder of the jug went into my own trash can. A new stash was purchased and for the past two weeks I have noticed that it is not draining as quickly as it used to.\\n\\nShe hasn\\'t said a word to me since. Not that she was actually talking to me before, but at least now she isn\\'t mooching off of somebody she hates.',\n",

       "  'selftext': '(Mobile so forgive formatting!!)\\n\\nI started working at my current work, which is a law firm, in October 2019. I was given a 6 month temp contract, and whilst I was happy with it at first this began to change. \\n\\nWhen I started there were 6 of us in my team; three including me being coordinators. My first week of work both coordinators went on sick leave/maternity leave which left my manager to train me. I quickly came to realise that my manager, who is PAINFULLY awkward and shy, doesn’t know how to do any of the coordinators work and instead of proper training I was told ‘being thrown into the deep end’ is the best way of learning and was told to ‘play around’ with the systems to learn. \\n\\nI started to really dislike my job as it was dull and there is a support/call centre who put calls through at random but are not the politest of people which started to take a toll on me, and by the fourth month of work 3/6 team members had left (which they had let me know was because of the incapability of the awkward manager). As my manager was then needing me otherwise the department would collapse, I agreed to stay but was looking elsewhere for jobs but I was just waiting for the 6 months to end so my agency would find me a new job. \\n\\nThen, coronavirus happened. By this time, the team was just me and my manager; due to only working with one person who is awkward and hard to speak to, I felt pretty bored and isolated with my job. When I’d have meetings with him there would be 20 seconds of silence between each of his points and speaking to him is painfully uncomfortable so it was easier for us to not chit chat generally. \\n\\nAs a result of basically the entire team leaving, my workload quadrupled. Having really disliked my job for months, and then having work piled onto me was EXHAUSTING. I’d have to finish work hours after my finishing time just to get everything done and in working order, and when I asked for overtime payment my manager shrugged it off saying that i don’t have to stay doing extra work (even though if I didn’t do extra it would only impact my own work). On my half year review after working up to it I asked if I could have a payrise due to doing 4x the work and as I am working more than my contracted hours. His response to this? ‘Oh we don’t do pay rises really’. That was shut down and wasn’t mentioned again. \\n\\nFast-forward to October, there had been a team member on our team who had been on sick leave for the last 2 years. I’d been told she had worked 2 out of the 8 years that she was working there. She then worked for 12 weeks and then went back on sick leave which fucked everyone over and again put all the pressure on me. \\n\\nAll whilst doing so much more work I have been awaiting endometriosis surgery which has been agonising to say the least. Two weeks ago I received a call from the hospital who let me know that a cancellation has popped up and I could be operated on the very next week. I signed off on the 7th and have been given a month to recover. To my manager saying I haven’t been doing more work since I started and not compensating overtime- Good luck! You’re gonna need it.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I work at a restaurant that specializes in cheesecake. Yes, that one. So, normally I work the curbside/to-go positions. I’ll either be bagging orders or running them out to the cars. One afternoon, this lady pulls into the curbside parking that we have out front and I run outside to get her name. \\n\\n“Oh I just placed my order like 30 seconds ago!” she says to me. I’ve dealt with people like this before so I just regurgitate, “Oh, that’s okay! Can you just park somewhere else while we prepare your order? These spots have a 10 minute parking limit. We’ll send you a text message when it’s ready and you can come back around.” Now, the thing with these curbside spots that we have in front of our restaurant is that they are literally IN FRONT of the restaurant so we have a continuous stream of cars that park there and get there orders as well as mall traffic that goes right alongside it basically creating some sort of choke point. \\n\\n“Ummm, I’ve parked here for longer before and no one has ever said anything.” At this point in the day, I wasn’t gonna deal with it because it was too early. So i just said “It’s just something that we are trying to enforce because we get a lot of traffic through here and it’s to make things run more smoothly.” She said “Okay, I’ll move. Don’t worry.” and then proceed to just stare at her phone. She did not move from that spot at all. So I just let it be.\\n\\nBut I made that woman wait. Her order was actually ready probably like 12 minutes after she pulled in but I made her wait 45 minutes. I attended to cars that pulled in behind her and cars that tried to go around her. and everytime she asked if her order was ready I’d say, “They’re just waiting on one item. It’ll be right out!” But no, she stayed in that spot for 45 minutes. \\n\\nWhen I decided she had had enough, I ran her order out. I made sure it was reheated so that she didn’t suspect anything. My coworkers loved the pettiness and I still tell that story probably once a week.',\n",

On my phone, English is my first language, etc.\\n\\nSophomore housing at my university consisted of seven students in a tiny three bedroom dormitory, with a small common space, kitchenette and single bathroom.  At the end of freshman year I managed to organize a pretty decent group of guys to live with, but due to a several summer dropouts, we ended getting several transfer students.  Things were sometimes tense, but the original guys usually managed to keep the peace.  The biggest ongoing challenge was theft of food, our private snacks and instant meals were constantly disappearing.  Every few weeks we would take turns asking the newer students to not eat our food, but it kept disappearing.\\n\\nCue petty revenge.  I sometimes volunteered at a pet store that sold dog treats that looked like Oreos.  I started buying 2-3 at a time and leaving them in the kitchen cabinet.  Every time they disappeared, I replaced them (always leaving them in the original clear plastic wrapping with pink dogs stickers on it).  After a few months I asked a roommate if he had seen any of the cookies in cabinet.  He said, “yeah, they tasted like shit.”  I replied, “that’s because they were dog food.  Quit stealing our food.”  Problem solved.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Okay, the title is kinda wonky, and idk if this belongs here, but here goes:\\n\\nSo, for some background (yeah, I know that’s said a lot in these stories): I’m a fairly young NB (Still a teen) and go to a school that doesn’t have a gym, but we still have a P.E. class. Our “gym” is a field we call the “lower field”, which is a soccer field with fake grass and boundary lines and such. Onto the story.\\n\\nMy P.E. teacher was having us play Ultimate Frisbee. If you don’t know how Ultimate works, it’s basically (at least, how I play it) that you’ve gotta get the frisbee past the boundary line of the opposite team, whoever has the frisbee isn’t allowed to move and can only throw the frisbee, that all you need to know for this story.\\n\\nThe only two people that are important to this story are Me and a classmate/teammate we’ll call Moose. \\n\\nSo, Moose had the frisbee and obviously couldn‘t move - per the rules - and there *were* 2 of my other teammates each about 7-9 meters away from Moose. But Moose couldn’t pass it to them because they were being covered by two people of the other team. I was further away, but I wasn’t being covered and I was closer to the goal of the opposite team. I was open as hell, and when I mean open, I mean I could’ve ran towards Moose and if nobody moved, I could’ve rammed into Moose without hitting anyone else.\\n\\nNow, I’d consider myself to be pretty good at Ultimate and, provided a good throw, I would’ve definitely been able to catch that frisbee. But no, he didn’t throw it to me. Even with the P.E. teacher and even people of the other team saying that he should throw it to me. And yet, he didn’t. \\n\\nWe we’re in that same position for about 2-3 minutes, with him still refusing to throw it to me. We even made eye contact a few times. Now, I’m impatient, like: If something is connected to me isn’t done real soon, I get a bit huffy. So us staying like this for like 2 minutes was pissing me off. \\n\\nNow, he looked like he was about to pass it to me, but within that moment, I knew what I was gonna do, if you’re not gonna pass it two me when I’m the only one open for 2 minutes, then fine, if you don’t want it, I won’t give it.\\n\\nI dropped my hands (something you do if you’re open to catch a frisbee) and said, “Okay, y’know what, he’s not gonna pass it to me, he’s not, he’s just not.” And walked away.\\n\\nI know it’s not the best petty revenge story, but hey, it made me feel pretty good about myself. If there’s a better place where I can post this, please tell me. And thanks for reading!',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'A little over 20 years ago, I trained to be an Over the Road driver at a trucking school, then got my first few jobs with various companies under a trainer. The long and the short of it is, I WAS **NOT** CUT OUT TO BE A TRUCK DRIVER!! \\n\\nMy first trainer had a flat route: Jersey to Cali, then back, total time - seven days. He made it abundantly clear that if I didn\\'t get him back in seven days, there\\'d be hell to pay. So after we got back, and I crashed in my room for three days from paranoia and no sleep, I got back out there with another company....who\\'s trainer goosed his rig to over 100 MPH. Most know that there are governors on trucks, that(at the time) won\\'t let them go over 65 miles an hour....in gear. This genius decided with a 40,000 pound load, to come rocketing out of the Denver Rockies at 65, shift the truck into NEUTRAL, and let gravity and Newton\\'s Laws speed the truck along.....okay, next company. The guy with the porn collection that filled my bunk, and a habit of spittin chewin tobacco left, right and sideways was almost the deal breaker. When I was done with him, I decided to stay with the company, but asked for a new trainer, waiting in a rinky-dink motel on a $50 per day lean against my paycheck. \\n\\nAfter two weeks, watching trucks go in and out, I see this wrecker dragging a truck and trailer into the lot. It literally looked like someone had picked the truck up, flipped it upside down, and ran it over a mandoline slicer; the cab, the engine, the whole thing just looked planed down to an XACTO-knife\\'s angle. \"But,\" I say to myself, \"I\\'ll never be that dumb...\"\\n\\nTo be clear, this was ALL before GPS, Mapquest or Googlemaps became popular. Back then, FCMSA rules stated that a driver could only ever work 10 hours a day. Trainers, and Trucking Companies played with the numbers, by figuring a truck could do 650 in that ten hours....so that\\'s what you had to do before you got outta the seat. Never mind that you can almost never START there, nor STAY there without breaking some kind of law. You cook your logbooks by measuring your work time based on total miles traveled, then write the rest off as you eating, sleeping or showering, so FCMSA/DOT never wonder if you\\'re being overworked. Essentially, your ten hour day, was usually 12-14 if you didn\\'t break the law. Little wonder why regular coffee, Red Bull, and Monster Energy Drinks were regularly going in and out of Truck Stops.\\n\\nEnter The Line. The Line was also a no-nonsense trainer. He wasn\\'t a bad guy, so long as you were bookin miles. But as I started going, I started feeling myself slow down. I just didn\\'t have the heart to keep doing this. When I got tired from driving, I started to slip into sleep(the constant drone of the engine, the white lines on the road blinking in and out of sight....it happens sadly. If it ever happens to you, DON\\'T brush it off: pull over and get some sleep or get out of the vehicle to wake yourself up) Well, The Line didn\\'t like that one bit. My last day with him, I\\'m somewhere near Chicago, on a highway I don\\'t remember getting on, that was pitch black save for my headlights. I know I was headed TO Chicago, but not where I was or how I was supposed to get there. I managed to just barely pull the truck back onto the road after drifting OVER the hazard bumps in the road. I stopped the truck, walked back to the Sleeper and woke him up.\\n\\nMe: Me.\\n\\nTL: The Line.\\n\\n\\\\-----\\n\\nMe: Listen, I\\'m exhausted. I can\\'t even understand the map anymore. I don\\'t know where I\\'m going. I gotta get some sleep.\\n\\nTL: What?!?! Look, just keep drivin till you get to the stop, then sleep.\\n\\nMe: Dude, I\\'m passing out behind the wheel. I barely got us back onto the road once. Does it make sense to play with BOTH our lives for a load?\\n\\nTL: This is MY truck Me. So you have two choices: drive this truck, or grab your stuff, and get out here. And if this little thought enters your head again, just remember that wherever you stop NEXT that isn\\'t our drop, is where you get out.... \\n\\nFor a moment, I wanna just rage at the guy, but I know I\\'ll never get anywhere. But anger brings a wonderful clarity to the mind. So, where I stop next is where I get out? Okay boss....\\n\\nI grab the mapbook and zero in on my location. I check our delivery point, and realize that I must have missed some turnoff, because we were supposed to drop somewhere outside of Chicago, but I was still headed towards it. But, Chicago had what I wanted: a Greyhound bus stop. \\n\\nSo, I drive three more hours, focused on ending this misery. We had a satellite uplink to our dispatcher, and I, being tech savvy and pissed enough, put on some of my music to cover any beeps from it...cause boy was I off the route. I pull into the Bus Terminal right next to a parked patrol car, shut the truck down and start grabbin my gear. The Line wakes up as he hears me packing.\\n\\nTL: So we\\'re there. (yawns)\\n\\nMe: Nope...\\n\\nTL: WHAT?!?!?! I TOLD YOU THAT IF YOU STOPPED THIS TRUCK AGAIN OUTSIDE OF THE STOP, YOU WERE GETTIN OUT!!!\\n\\nI grabbed the sleeper curtain and flung it wide open to show the bus terminal.\\n\\nMe: I found your terms acceptable....this is where I\\'m getting out.\\n\\nThe Line starts to get up with fury in his eyes, and though he was smaller than me, it\\'s clear he wasn\\'t letting size dictate anything. Neither was I as I flashed my logbook in his face.\\n\\nMe: It\\'s gonna be an interesting discussion with that officer there, how you\\'ve had me driving for the last fourteen hours straight, even when I told you I was too tired to drive.\\n\\nThe Line glares at me like he was trying to pummel me by thought alone\\n\\nTL: You\\'ll never work as a Driver again...I PROMISE you.\\n\\nI smile again, a mix of cheer, madness and rage in my little laugh that makes even The Line move back.\\n\\nMe: Again, something we wholeheartedly agree on. By the way, Dispatch might want a word with you. I know where we are: NOT our drop point. \\n\\nI climb out of the truck and he speeds off into the early morning. Turned out the cop car was empty, cause the officer went inside to use the bathroom. But I borrowed some money from my mother, who was all too eager to get me back to Jersey after what I told her. Slept for four hours on the Terminal floor before my bus....best day\\'s sleep of my life.\\n\\nTo be fair, I understand the industry is getting better. With more precise GPSing, and smartphones that can keep drivers in touch no matter what, the days of drivers being worked till they crash is slowly coming to an end. But that\\'s also why Trucking\\'s now paying $70,000+ for a driver with five years and NO accidents: there\\'s very few that weren\\'t trained to treat their rigs as a bumper car....\\n\\nI drove truck one last time as a wildcatter on-call to deliver stuff to Delaware. Not a bad job, but I realized trucking just wasn\\'t for me. I got into computing, and haven\\'t looked back since.',\n",

He was shouting out I'd be shit, I should get someone to take them for me, I couldn't do that as I was female and half blind, I shouldn't even been on a shooting range.  Game on.

I had nothing to lose. \\n\\nIt was all set up and I am actually quite a good shot (which scared my husband) and I didn't get a picture of it but I got 10 in the A.

       "  'selftext': 'So I quit my job because the schedule was fucking me up super bad. I was starting to get really depressed about it and I hated coming in everyday so I decided to quit last minute which isn’t a good look. How I got the job was through an acquaintance(lets name this person Alex). My ex manager is friendly with Alex and they both like to talk shit. So my ex boss told Alex that I was a terrible worker and I came to work drunk and that I asked for more hours. I did show up to work hungover which I’m not proud of and I’m guessing my ex boss noticed. But I never asked for more hours and I was up for a promotion, so if I was so terrible why wasn’t I fired? They always told me I was such a hard worker and now they’re trying to make me look like an alcoholic. My ex boss and Alex like spreading gossip so I’m guessing people I don’t even know are going to talk shit about me even though they are painting a picture they wanted heard and not my side. It just makes me feel sad and upset and guilty that they’re making me out to look like that. I guess that’s my ex bosses revenge for me quitting out of the blue and leaving when they needed me to stay.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I don\\'t remember exactly when this took place, but it was definitely before Halo Reach debuted so Halo 3 multi-player was still at its height. I would play every day after school and every weekend since it was the only game I had. So, I was pretty good for a 13 year old at the time. \\n\\nI loaded up into a match of Big Team Slayer on Sandtrap. I always enjoyed getting the banshee immediately after spawning in, but someone beat me to it so I figured I\\'d get the next one, no big deal. My teammate quickly took out the enemy banshee so I played center of map waiting for it to respawn. \\n\\nIt came back up so I ran quick, only to have it blown up right in my face. I looked around expecting to fight, but it\\'s the same teammate in the scorpion that blew it up. I got onto him expecting an apology, but his response was \"If I gave the banshee to some shit squeaker, you\\'d just get it stolen, and I wouldn\\'t get a perfection medal.\" \\n\\nNo apology. No medal. He was 9/0 when it happened so he was right about probably getting a perfection medal, and I was well aware I was a squeaker. But I was 7/1 so calling me shit was all it took to make me upset. I spent some time trying to damage his scorpion, but he would just drive away. One time he even blew me up, which was prefect. \\n\\nI managed to grab another banshee and proceeded to shoot his scorpion with light guns over and over. You can see someone\\'s shield break, and that would be my cue to circle around again. I did this 4 or 5 times, not killing him, but definitely damaging his scorpion and making him upset. He was 13/0 at this point and was cussing me out over voice chat. I wasn\\'t responding at all, just proceeding with the plan. \\n\\nEventually he had enough and blew me up banshee and all. But that\\'s exactly what I was waiting for. That was the second time he team killed me in the same match so I got to kick him, 2 kills shy of his medal. I\\'m sure he got it another match, but I doubt he called his teammates shit when he was trying again.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'TLDR; Girl made fun of me. I spent the next 6 months working out just so I could curve her in front of everyone. She acts like a child and ends up leaving the trip early.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis happened last year. I went to a party at my friends\\' place. A girl (Gabby) that was there clearly did not like me so I just didn\\'t bother talking to her that night. Flash forward to the next week, my friend (Alicia) is telling me that Gabby is calling me a r\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* (dont know if that words censored) saying \"Oh yeah with his vibes he\\'s definitely raped someone\". I did not like this but I knew that I was going on a camping trip with a group of friends in a couple of months with Gabby included so I started my plan.\\n\\nAt that point, I wasn\\'t the biggest guy but I definitely had a dad bod. I decided \"fuck this girl\" and I started working out religiously for the next 6 months. I hated every second of it I cannot stress how much I hated this keep in mind this was during covid so all I had access to was bodyweight and running, I do not even want to know the number of pushups I did, how many hours I spent of the floor dying from abs, or my lungs being on fire as I\\'m running around like a dufus. By the end, I was in pretty good shape I had a good 6 pack and was around 8% body fat at 6\\' even and 203 pounds  (I got into the fitness stuff along the way and dropped it all off after this)\\n\\nThe camping trip comes. When I showed up Gabby asked Alicia  \"who the man-beef was?\" (ik cringey af) and she told her \"that\\'s the guy you said\\'s a r\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\". As the trip goes on she was by me all the time, flirting, getting really handsy. She\\'s a very attractive girl so I of course was flirting back and this went on for two days. During the 3rd day we went to the lake and, as all drunk college kids at the lake do, started a game of chicken. I looked at Gabby and picked her up throwing her on top of me. We ended up losing but as Gabby was getting up from underwater she grabbed me and made sure to rub up against me the whole way up. I knew that I got her on the line and I just needed to do a little more before embarrassing her. Come nighttime we were all sitting around the camping table/bench thing playing some drinking game (I do not remember what it was) and it eventually led to people kissing each other. This girl prided herself on being able to bag anyone she wanted (which I am now realizing I should have said earlier in the story because it\\'s the only thing that caused her embarrassment). Eventually, it was my turn to play or hers or whatever who gives a fuck but it did lead to her trying to kiss me and I decided I lose and went to the restroom. Everyone was laughing around the table at that and I was happy enough. \\n\\nGabby however was not. She decided not even two minutes later to follow me to the bathroom. I forgot to lock the bathroom door (drunk me ain\\'t the smartest) and Gabby comes in right behind me. She starts rubbing against me and kissing my neck telling me nasty things. I thought I already got my revenge at that and just didn\\'t want to do anything with her. This led to her being angry and starting to yell at me. I was having none of it and told her let\\'s just go back and play the games. She legit sits down on the ground pouting like a child saying she won\\'t go and I\\'d have to carry her or she\\'s staying here all night. I grab her and throw her over my shoulder and she kept the child act up and was kicking and punching as if she\\'s a toddler. It obviously causes a commotion and my friends come over to see what\\'s wrong. I put her down and she starts screaming at me talking a million words a minute before finally yelling \"THIS F\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*T WON\\'T FUCK ME!\". There was a beat of silence as everyone looked around and then we all started dying. Everyone was making fun of her and she could not stand it she ran into a tent and didn\\'t come out. By the time I woke up the next morning her car was gone and she had left our group chat.\\n\\nI honestly do regret doing it not because of what happened to her (she acted like a child and I take no responsibility for that) but because I had to spend 6 months working out every day and eating 100% clean when I\\'d rather just not do that.',\n",

Her mother, when she was young, used to make fun of my mother, constantly berating her physical appearance. So before the meeting, my mom actually warned me about their behaviour, bless her.\\n\\n\\nWell, this girl, on the very first day, made a rude comment about my nose being too big, eyes too small etc. Now, i know I\\'m above the average but these kind of comments did make me insecure a little. She acted like she was the Lady Diana herself. Like, once she asked me to \"cover the mirrors in my house when she comes over bcz after seeing her, the mirror\\'s standards would be too high and the next time it sees me, it\\'ll shatter\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last straw was when she looked at my baby brother and said that HE is the reason she doesn\\'t want kids bcz what if her kids turned out just as ugly as him. Her mom kinda laughed awkwardly and told her that he look exactly like me when i was young. This girls went \"ewwww\" directly at my face. That\\'s it, that. Was. It.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy uncle asked for our childhood photos so that we could see if she was any cuter than me, i was willing to show mine, but she was kinda hesitant. She said she didn\\'t have any. She doesn\\'t wanna show them? Okay i know what I\\'m gonna do now!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI spent the whole weekend searching for her and my pictures and put them all in photo album. When the next time we had a family gathering, i asked for everyone\\'s attention and ask them to look at our old photos. Everyone was enthusiastic. I handed them the album and on the very first page, there was a picture of me, a cute little teddy bear (lmao) and her, a crooked teethed monkey who looked like it had been marinating in car oil for 3 years straight. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInitially she was like, \"Ewww that baby\\'s ugly asf\" but when she realized that it was actually HER,  she was extremely embarrassed. Then she accused me of \"editing\" my pictures to look good and hers to look like that. Before i even had to say anything, my uncle went, \"(cousin), there\\'s no way she could edit these printed pictures from the 2010\\'s. I don\\'t understand, you look EXACTLY LIKE THAT.\" They all started laughing and i finally got my revenge lol.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe and i don\\'t talk anymore and i hope it stays that way',\n",

I had - incorrectly - assumed that he would opt to not mooch off me and open a new one. \\n\\nRather than change the password, I seized the chance to be ✨petty✨. I changed the settings for his profile so that he could only view shows for children under 5, and updated the language settings to Korean.\\n\\nHonestly, it's still one of my finest moments to date.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Between Italy and Germany, there are quite a few Autobahns, where you can practically drive as fast as you want. The left lane is reserved for faster drivers and the right lane is for slower drivers or to move over so someone can pass. The Autobahn almost always has a substantial amount of work being done on it somewhere along most routes to make sure the roads are in superb condition for driving at those speeds. My wife and I are foreigners living in Germany for work and are cruising at 100MPH/160KPH for most of our trip without any rude drivers for about 9 hours of the drive from Italy back to Germany. I love driving btw, I find it quite enjoyable.\\n\\nWe come upon some substantial construction that slows both the left and right lane down. Without missing a beat, some guy, lets call him, Nice A\\\\*\\\\*hole comes up behind us and begins tailgating and I mean HARD. In Germany, if you want someone to move out of your way that is in the left lane, you turn on your left blinker, letting them know you want them to move over so you can pass.\\n\\nAt this point all of the traffic is going the same speed and there is no need to pass as this won\\'t get you anywhere and its almost impossible to pass. Nice A\\\\*\\\\*hole puts on his left blinker, leaves it on and even honks at us \"huge NO-NO as this is usually prohibited\" since he wants to pass. My wife gives me a \"please don\\'t do anything rash look and starts looking at alternate routes on our GPS\". I calmly drive for a few more minutes with all of the traffic going the same speed when I see an opening on the right to get over with enough room to also get back in behind our Nice A\\\\*\\\\*hole friend.\\n\\nI signal, change lanes to the right, our friend moves one stupid car length forward to the car I was behind and turns on his left turn signal at the next car.\\n\\nMy whole life up to this point has been great, so why not chance it?\\n\\nI signal, change lanes directly behind Nice A\\\\*\\\\*hole and put on my left blinker. Nice A\\\\*\\\\*hole quickly becomes Angry A\\\\*\\\\*hole, swerves to the right lane, pulls up right beside me, rolls down his window and starts yelling at my wife and I while shaking his fist at us while hanging out his window.\\n\\nIt\\'s time for revenge, especially since we have our sleeping babies in the car, and how dare he yell at my children.\\n\\nAngry A\\\\*\\\\*hole keeps motioning for me to pull off at the next exit with the obvious intent to fight as he keeps motioning with his fist and yelling while swerving around his lane. \\n\\nMy wife is honestly, pretty dang smart, and purposefully has me keep skipping exits for awhile until one specific exit comes up.\\n\\nRight before this exit she tells me to go ahead and let him know we are getting off at this **SPECIFIC** exit. Angry A\\\\*\\\\*hole steers hard into the exit lane, ready to bring the wrath of middle aged man onto everything I hold dear. I\\'m a redhead, I\\'m game for a bit of fisticuffs and I\\'m slightly stupid, so I begin to signal to change lanes and exit with him.\\n\\nMy wife with and extreme intensity just says \"Keep driving\". At this exact moment Angry A\\\\*\\\\*hole realizes he done effed up. He cant get back onto the Autobahn since he drove too far into the exit to get back on, and has to exit the road. What I didn\\'t know and what Angry A\\\\*\\\\*hole didn\\'t know is that specific exit adds a hour and a half to anyone\\'s trip since there are no re-entry\\'s to the main road for that exit only.\\n\\nMy wife had looked up and planned this revenge from the start.',\n",

The asshat lives rent free and has no respect for house rules or for me or my SO.\\n\\nWe\\'ve had a lot of issues with him and my spineless SO has done close to nothing to make the situation better.\\n\\nSo this dude is out of town right now and my SO is at work. I get out of my room only to discover the only bathroom in the house full with his clothes. I go to the kitchen and there\\'s an actual giant  ass garbage bag that he\\'s been collecting since idk, 1998? \\n\\nSo I\\'m done, right? I\\'ve been living like an animal for a month and because this excuse of an adult is supposed to leave for good EVENTUALLY, my SO wants nothing to do with the hygene situation. So today y dragged the giant ass bag into the asshat\\'s room, and used his tshirt to clean my toilet, then also threw it into his room. It\\'s 32° during the day, so I\\'m going for a \"wtf happened here\" stench inside his room. I\\'m probably going to end up back at my mum\\'s after the shitstorm that is coming after my SO and his brother find out what I\\'ve done, but revenge is indeed, very nice and very sweet.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Few years ago I used to work in a small pub, in a small town. I was the only waitress working the shift and our official closing time was 10 pm. But it was very rare to close at that time. My boss had a rule that I can close at 22.00 only when there were no customers. If there were some, I had to stay longer with them, until they went home themselves. This was that type of town where everyone knows each other but in winter and summer there was a lot of tourists because the town was in the middle of mountains. \\n\\nThe pub was situated next to the restaurant and a hotel which had its own small pizza restaurant open to public. The hotel restaurant closed at 22.00 as well. There were two male waiters and a chef who often came to my pub after the shift. But what they did was that the chef came at 21.55 to my pub (so I couldn't close at 22.00 because I had a customer) ordered a beer and waited for those other two guys. They usually stayed there for another hour or two. It quickly became a game of who can close the place first so I didn't have to stay overtime for so long. I liked those guys, I sometimes hanged out with them when they were in pub but I didn't like them enough for extra overtime hours everyday.   \\nI also had a school in the morning so I had to wake up at 5.00.\\n\\nSo here comes my revenge....  \\nIt was summer so there were a lot of tourists around. This evening a guy came and asked if we served food, I said we didn't and checked the time. It was around 21.15. One restaurant was already closed but the pizza restaurant at the hotel was still open. I told him to hurry up so he can have at least pizza.\\n\\nThe evening was bussy so I had to stay overtime anyway and it was definitely worth it because otherway I wouldn't find out what I caused. Around 11pm here comes the chef. Pissed and exhausted. He sits at the bar, asks for a beer and start talking. I wouldn't believe what just happened. \\n\\nThe restaurant was ready to close, everything cleaned when at 9.45 pm the huge group of tourists came in and ordered 8 pizzas and drinks! The chef was fuming with anger, downed the beer and left. Oh the satisfaction I felt! He never found out I was the one who sent those tourists.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I work for a company that does commercial cleaning jobs, mostly restrooms, in businesses around the area. I have a big machine I pressure wash bathrooms with that has a cleaning chemical in the water. I put up plenty of signs while I clean that say the bathrooms are closed for cleaning. The ones I have hang at eye level in the door frames and you have to physically duck to get under them. \\n\\nI frequently get people who come up and look at the signs and ask if they can use the restrooms, which I always politely say no because they’re closed for cleaning and I have a cleaning chemical on all of the fixtures. They usually are fine with that and either wait or go to a different one. \\n\\nI clean both the men’s and women’s at the same time when I do these so sometimes I’ll be inside of one of the restrooms and don’t see someone sneak into the other one to use it. This means I have to sit there and wait for them to finish before I can finish cleaning that restroom. If they’re fast, I might just give them a look but if they cost me a lot of time, I’ll tell them that I hope they don’t get a rash. They usually get confused so I explain that the chemicals I spray on the fixtures are harmful to the skin and that’s why I have to close the restrooms while I work. I usually put on a worried sympathetic face and tell them that they may want to go take a shower as quickly as possible, otherwise it might get really uncomfortable to sit down for the next few weeks. This usually freaks them out a bit and they rush away. Our chemicals are actually pretty harmless so long as it’s not straight from the jug of undiluted, which if I sprayed it down, it’s been heavily diluted so it won’t ever cause a problem but that fear feels really good to someone who thought the rules didn’t matter to them.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'A couple of weeks ago me and my family and my SIL’s family were walking around a lake near our home. The lake has gotten bad over the years, often you’ll get youths going and drinking there. We walked past an area that was messy we’re there’d obviously been a party. My brother in law was taking a phone call just as some teens approached us. My brother in law is french and was speaking in french on the phone. The teens told us to clean up our mess or to go back from where we came from. My sister in law and I grabbed the kids and started moving away with our husbands blocking the path of the teens. They tried to push past them so worrying about the kids my husband pushed one back and he fell over into the mud. They tan off and we thought end of story. \\nMy SIL works in a local hairdressers and a few days later a woman came in to speak to the manager. She claimed her son was attacked for asking people to take their mess home with them and SIL was one of the attackers. The manager said she’d look into what happened. There’s a local fishing group that use the lake so I emailed and asked if any members saw what happened with the confrontation. Two got back and confirmed our version of events, one even told us of the school the kids are in. We contacted the school and theirs a police officer who works with the school and the kids are all on a racial awareness course and warned if they carry on they could be in trouble with the law. The mother has also been banned from the hairdressers.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Mobile and first time poster disclaimers, also sorry for the long post.\\n\\nNow this literally just happened... About an hour or so ago. For some background my wife and I had our first child on the 13th, so yes about a day (almost 2 at this point) ago and my wife\\'s best friend had really generously organised a Youfoodz order for us, so we didn\\'t have to worry about cooking and what not for a bit. (For those that don\\'t know Youfoodz is like pre-packaged meals that come as a bundle, microwave packs, very nice food). \\n\\nOn to the story, ME - will be your truly, BF - Best Friend, RL - rude lady that makes me question human decency.\\n\\nMy wife calls this morning to say that the Youfoodz order was delivered the night before and to have a look around. I check all out the front and don\\'t see anything.\\n\\nBF calls me\\n\\nBF: I\\'m so sorry, the order was sent to the wrong address on the street! *Apologising profusely*. A lady has messaged me saying she has my package, but hasn\\'t confirmed if it\\'s the Youfoodz, I think it is.\\n\\nMe: no worries at all, I\\'ll go around and get it from them!\\n\\nAbout 500m down the road I get to the address and knock on the door.\\n\\nRL:  yes?\\n\\nMe: So sorry to bug you, but my friend (BFs name) called and let me know that you might have a package under her name? A Youfoodz order? My wife and I just had our first child and she has accidentally sent to wrong address.\\n\\nRL: No I don\\'t have anything\\n\\n*Closes door*\\n\\nMe: oh... Okay...sorry (said to closing door)\\n\\nMeanwhile BF is trying to contact the lady that messaged, has seen all messages but not responding. \\n\\n30mins later BF confirms with Youfoodz the order was definitely delivered to that address, still no contact. I head back over.\\n\\nKnock again 4 times - no answer\\n\\nAgain, 4 knocks - dogs barking, no answer, but I can hear someone inside.\\n\\nNow I\\'m frustrated, I know you\\'re home, just answer the door. Knocking more and more.\\n\\nBF calls again\\n\\nBF: she messaged again *forwards screenshot*\\n\\nGist of message \"I don\\'t have your package, I didn\\'t have to in fridge so I left it outside and now it\\'s gone. Someone must have taken it. You need to contact Youfoodz, leave me alone, blah blah blah\"\\n\\nObviously this woman has just gone and stolen our order...who would just leave a whole box of food outside?\\n\\nPetty Revenge is suddenly handed to me... StarTrack truck pulls up next to me in driveway, I\\'m chatting with him and letting him know no one is answering.\\n\\nHe leaves a card to collect the parcel and goes on his way...\\n\\nI confirm the name on the card is the name of RL messaging BF. I take the card, head round the side of the house and tuck it away in the metre box...\\n\\nWho seriously steals a food delivery that isn\\'t for you AFTER messaging saying that it was delivered to wrong address!? I hope your package gets sent back!',\n",

During summer my parents would take me off of it and would feed me what ever I asked for. I loved smoked turkey legs and they sold them everywhere at the theme park we were at. With how little I eat my parents hated anyone picking on me eating since I never passed 42lb until I was 12.\\n\\nWhile in line I was gnawing on the bone of a turkey leg savoring the flavor and knowing I would need to throw it away when we got on the ride. The ladies behind me saw me this skin and bone 42lb 8 or 9 year old child gnawing on a bone and started to call me a dog to each other. I could not hear them but my mom did. Angry at these ladies for calling me a dog My mom backed up on them and farted right on them. My mom is lactose intolerant and was eating cheese and dairy because it was vacation so it must have smelled bad.\\n\\nIt was ironic that they were calling me a dog I mean bitches calling someone else a dog is the pot calling the kettle black situation.',\n",

One of the leaders met us at the campsite with a van so we didn\\'t have to carry grills and food in the canoes.  The knuckleheads who left me in the dark decided they would sleep \"in style\" on the bench seats of the van instead of on a tent.\\n\\nCue  revenge.

This is a drive I make quite frequently, so I like to set my cruise control and just go. \\n\\nI’m creeping up on a car in the right lane, so I do the responsible thing and move to the left to pass them. Right as I’m about level with them, they speed up, and after a mile or so, I slow down and just get back over to the right. I’m not gonna worry about passing them since they sped up. \\n\\nWell, apparently they don’t know how to set their cruise control, because sure enough, another 3 miles-ish down the road, I’m creeping up on them again. So I move over to the left lane to pass them again, and sure enough, they speed up to prevent me from passing them. \\n\\nSo now I’m kind of annoyed. I’m not trying to play games on the road, but I AM trying to pass this dumbo. I look ahead and see there is an 18 wheeler ahead on the right, in the other guys lane. I see dumbo speeding up to get ahead of ME now, to pass the 18 wheeler, and I kinda snapped. I sped up so he couldn’t merge into my lane, then when I got alongside the 18 wheeler I slowed down to a comfortable 55 mph to match the 18 wheeler. I drove like that for 5 miles to teach this jerkbag a lesson.\\n\\nPlease people, just set your damn cruise control!',\n",

The customer I was working with qualified for that conquest rebate.\\n\\nHowever before I closed him he was browsing on his phone and he saw a competing dealer offering a very similar F150 for $35k. Now our offer to him was basically invoice minus rebates. \\n\\nI knew this dealership was lying on several fronts and I explained that, how the dealer got to the $35k price was:\\n\\n* They didn\\'t include freight or prep in any of their advertising, they had small print saying this\\n* They stacked rebates that weren\\'t stackable. \\n* They included every single conditional rebate possible, again you won\\'t qualify for those rebates\\n* They had mandatory add ons such as vin etching, nitrogen in tires, and tinting that they didn\\'t tell you about until you got there, also they charged a lot for those options.\\n* I also knew the GM at this dealership never did invoice deals, ever. \\n\\nI tried to explain my customer this, and of course he didn\\'t believe me cause i\\'m a car sales man and no one should trust a salesman.\\n\\nI then explained to him its close to closing, I know what the inventory on his vehicle looks like and its really unlikely the conquest rebate of $1,500 will be available come tomorrow.\\n\\nHe said he\\'s going go to them and get a better deal since we refuse to beat their offer (we couldn\\'t if we\\'d have matched their offer we\\'d be losing our ass) I told him, the price we offered is off the table the second we close up shop for the night and tomorrow the deal could be completely different.\\n\\nHe goes there, next afternoon he comes back fuming pissed, he asks me\\n\\n* Can you believe they wanted to charge me freight and prep? (Yes I can)\\n* Can you believe they included rebates I didn\\'t qualify for? (yes I can)\\n* Can you believe they included rebates that can\\'t be combined? (Yes I can)\\n* Can you believe they wanted to charge me thousands and thousands of dollars for bullshit add ons? (Yes I can)\\n\\nI asked him what price they finally came to, he said $42,500 and I asked him if he bought the truck. He said \"No way in hell was I going pay $2,500 for the same damn truck then I could get from you!\" I smiled and I said \"So you want the truck?\"\\n\\nHe goes \"Yes lets just get this over with\"\\n\\nI said \\'Well, unfortunately the conquest rebate didn\\'t get renewed so your new price is $41,500\"\\n\\nHe stares blanky at me and said \"Are you fucking kidding\" and I go \"Nope, here I can show you\"\\n\\nSo I show him the list of rebates from the month prior, and the expiration date on those rebates (which was yesterday) and then I showed him the new list of rebates which clearly showed no conquest rebate\\n\\nHe looks at me goes \"Look if you don\\'t honor the price you gave me yesterday I\\'m just going back to the other place\"\\n\\nI laugh and go \"Every dealer has access to the exact same rebates, they also don\\'t have the conquest rebate anymore, so if yesterday their price was $42,500 today their price is going be $44,000\"\\n\\nHe huffs and puffs and buys\\n\\nBefore I get yelled at for being sleazy, rebates are not money from our dealership, rebates are money directly from the factory. If the factory decides to stop offering a rebate, I have zero control over that. Also even though he paid more, my commission stayed the same because our offer was the same \"invoice minus rebates\" its just less rebates.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'On mobile. Sorry for the formatting. \\n\\nA little background: My grandma and I lived in some shitty apartments for almost 10 years(nana doesn’t get good income, she babysits kids as a job and isn’t a citizen here). Also, my mom never lived with us (this part sort of matters later). Our apartment complex itself was pretty shitty, and problems that had to do with the apartment’s poor maintenance were always happening. As any other resident would, my grandma would ask for these things repaired, but nothing would ever get fixed nor would anyone come take a look at our apartment. \\n\\n\\nThe majority of people that worked and lived in these apartments knew my grandma, she was even pretty close to the old managers at some point. Years pass, and during our last year there, new managers and employees began working at the office. \\n\\nIn addition to the shit service, the ladies over at the apartment’s office would began harassing my grandma any time she’d go up there. They’d treat her poorly, sometimes ignore her, and even laugh in her face. Eventually they got tired of her complaining about their poor service and maintenance, that the owners of the complex did not want to renew her lease(which was coming up in about a month). \\n\\n\\nAs soon as my grandma told me all these things, I was furious, deep down I knew how wrong this was and nobody should ever be treated that way. Nobody. I was only 17 at that time, so there wasn’t much I could do. I called up my mom and told her everything. She was as enraged as me, drove up to the office and made sure everyone in the office had to hear what the fuck she had to say.\\n\\nBad move. That same day, an officer and the bitch manager comes to our door handing us a paper stating that we had until that WEEKEND to move out because of the scene my mom made. No apartment complex(at least in our area) let’s you move in just a couple of days, it usually takes a couple of weeks, so you can imagine the hurt my grandma felt.\\n\\nMy mom gets in contact with her lawyer, he comes over (very kind man by the way) and takes photos of our apartment for his letter that he was going to send to the owners of the complex. The next day, he walks with my grandma into the office, hands them the letter and leaves. I don’t know exactly what the letter said, but from his words it was enough evidence to take them to court.\\n\\nThe ladies at the office were very much afraid since a lawyer was involved and their job was on the line. The owners of the complex knew that their workers and they themselves were in the wrong so they gave us the option to renew or to have a month to move out. \\n\\nAt the end, I told my grandma that it wasn’t fair that she had to experience that there, even after 120 months of paying rent on time. We packed our shit and got another apartment, and so many more families moved out because they were being treated the same way.\\n\\nAs we were getting the last of our things, i decided “hmm... i’ll just get my cats a new litter box on the way to our new apartment” and threw their nasty litter inside the room I would sleep in’s closet. I also left the old litter box there.\\n\\nMy little “revenge” wasn’t much but it really made me laugh especially because the ladies at the office are the ones who come in and inspect the apartment. To me, it was a big FUCK YOU right to their stupid faces, as well as the owners who had to pay money to clean that carpet (if they even cleaned it...)',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I was reading about some people how they quit their job on the spot and the company went under. this is when I was part of a mass walk off.\\n\\nThis happened in the late 90\\'s when I worked for a concrete company. We were the ones pouring foundations, footings, floors, etc. It was long hours but the pay was good. Most of the guys on the crews were awesome people with a great work ethic. We also had some that were slower but not too slow to impede the job. \\n\\nWell bossman was a micromanaging, interfering, loud, (I don\\'t think I ever heard him when he wasn\\'t yelling) and didn\\'t think anything about grabbing a worker to yell in his face. One week before the walk out we were working on a foundation for a kiln at a saw mill. There wasn\\'t enough people in all the crews to do the job so he hired some locals to work until the job was finished and paid the same as us. We didn\\'t care. More hands more work done and them getting paid the same as us we considered they were lucky. no hard feelings and seemed to get along with all the new guys.\\n\\nOne of the new guys was not shown how to do a certain task and thought \"who better to show me than bossman?\" So he walked over and asked to be shown. That is when all hell broke loose. Not sure if bossman was already in a bad mood or if this caused it but within a second of asking, bossman had the guy by the throat against a wall and slapped him so hard he fell over the safety fence and had a 4 foot fall to the concrete floor. Bossman just walked off the job site and drove away. \\n\\nThis was a time when cell phones weren\\'t very common and none of us had one but the 2 way radio in the truck had an emergency channel. The foreman radioed for an ambulance and police. The foreman went in the ambulance with the worker and filled out his police report at the hospital. Lucky for the worker he ended up with just bruising and nothing broken. \\n\\nSince the foreman was the second in charge he had all of out home numbers and gave each of us a personal call to let us know the hospital report and to ask us to get together for a group chat. All of us showed up. Except one, the guy who got hurt. We passed it off he was to sore and thought no more on it. Not only because it was at a pub and the first round was free, but to find out what everyone\\'s thoughts were. Other than the new guys we were all happy enough to just walk away like bossman did and let him suffer the consequences of breech of contract with the saw mill. They just wanted the money. This is when our \\'except one\" limped in.\\n\\nHe told us he just came from home after talking to the officer in charge of the case and said bossman just was arrested for assault causing bodily harm. or something of that sort. I can\\'t remember right off. That settled it with the locals. They were all charging him with breach of contract since he hired them to complete this job and now they can\\'t. The next day we were all at the job site and when bossman showed up we each walked up to him and said directly in his face, \"I QUIT\" then went to our vehicles and drove away in parade fashion. \\n\\nHe ended up with such big fines through his company for breach of contract at the saw mill that took up everything he had saved and he had to sell off equipment to make ends meet. Then came the 6 or so temp employees with their claims. The court sided with all of them and he was made to pay out each contract in full. That broke him and he had to let the bank take almost everything. I don\\'t know why but his wife stuck with him even though she admits he got his just dessert. She comes from a family of money so even if he is broke she is not.\\n\\nEven more fallout. Remember that guy he threw over the fence? Yeah, he won his case too and bossman had to spend close to 5 months in county jail, a huge fine he couldn\\'t pay, 1 year anger management courses, and volunteer at the local foodbank. If there was more I can\\'t think of it right now. \\n\\nIn the end his in-laws loaned him the money to start up again and for the last 10 years has been doing good for himself and is actually a great man to work for. I like to think that his entire work force walking out one by one had something to do with it. I hope this fits as revenge.',\n",

Fast forward the 30 days, on day 33 she decides now would be a convenient time to get her stuff. Oops! By day 31 I had scattered it across every thrift shop/donation center in town. What makes that so great is that she was HUGE into thrift store shopping. I never heard if she came across any of her things or not.

       "  'selftext': 'I worked for a company that host a scheduling platform for independently contracted PRN staffing. It was the definition of harassment (both sexually and religiously). It was a bunch of arrogant alcoholic men and a shock for someone like me (I didn’t believe places like this actually existed). Anyway, it wasn’t long before both the sexually and religiously inappropriate remarks began. I said nothing as many remarks were said in-front of the CEO and further remarks made by the newly hired president thy hired to foster better relations. So, to those women who complain, I feel you and it’s shocking these people are stuck in some disgusting 80’s film. Anyway, the one guy who bother me the most began to become more aggressive and this was around the time we hired a friend of mine (she called one of the guys a pervert- it was perfect). Anyway, this was many years ago and I do not recall what he did or said that pushed me to the limit, but it involved an inappropriate email. So, I forwarded the email to the CEP and CFO stating how his unprofessional demeanor was becoming intolerable and that I felt he was doing it because of my religious believes. So, the CFO was there and pulled me into his office... the guy was tearing up (he was afraid of being sued) and told me that they were firing my friend that day...  so, they fired my friend bc she believed she collected funds and the president told her she could open up a clients credit to continue receiving staffing. They were going to fire the president, but he pushed the blame on a girl who was with the company for maybe a month. Anyway, the president also made remarks about my religion and I made it very clear that I did not feel comfortable bring this up to anyone as it was just swept under the rug. With that, other guy who was taunting me was also involved in my friend be fired... so, I ding both of them. The one guy thought he was untouchable, but I know that he was written up because they had to basically and the president... come lent. Ugh, he had the ash on his forehead and everything. Like, Jesus gave his life to save others and he hypocritically wears that. Silly. Anyway, both my friend and I found awesome and well paying jobs in the software industry after leaving that POS place. And yea, they fired me shortly after I made another complaint about the sexual harassment. I laughed at them in their faces and told them I hope nothing like this happens to their daughters. Could I have sued with a paper trail to support me, yes. I chose to be happy instead',\n",

There was fire coming off his tires like he was Ghost Rider or some shit.    \\nOf course, he nailed the speed bump anyway, and ended up driving away far more slowly after a few seconds of staying still and (probably/hopefully) contemplating his life choices. I bet his tire treads are flat as hell. Hope he learned his lesson!',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I worked at a fairly well to do cafe in a tourist town in Canada a few years back where the uniform was black top black trousers black shoes black apron. I was the only guy on staff who worked service (the other guys were in the kitchen) so it was me and around 4-8 girls on the counter, all of us aged in our late teens or early 20s. Uniform was not super strict, just wear black and look fairly smart.\\n\\nOne of the girls would regularly wear a top that would drape down off one of her shoulders. No big deal right? I dont think anyone ever noticed cared or commented on it. She looked nice, on the casual side of smart casual. \\n\\nOne day a couple of us overheard an unnassuming middle aged female customer in the queue say in a carrying whisper to her companion something along the lines of \"I didnt realise they were allowed to dress like *sluts* in here!\" whilst nodding at the offending shoulder. \\n\\nIm not sure why we still served the woman, minimum wage jobs can do that to you, or maybe the people who heard werent the ones on service. Who knows. Anyway what she said quickly got around. Within about 2 minutes everyone had either gotten an extra shoulder or two out (if their clothes allowed it) or unbutton their shirt or blouse an extra step or two. I think I got volunteered to go over to bus the tables around her with my shirt down 3 buttons and my very white, untoned and fairly hairy chest on display. I dont think she ever came back.',\n",

Mostly dudes worked at the this bagel shop, who used to usually give her all the attention, but once I started working all the attention shifted to me (i had bf, I didn’t care for it) that’s the only reason I could think she didn’t like me. Through out the months she’d be a bitch to me over little things. I got promoted to shift lead which I’m sure she couldn’t stand even more. One day after closing I accidentally left my iPod touch at work. I said no biggie, I get in right after the baker in the morning tomorrow so it’ll still be there. Nope. Once I get in my iPod is GONE. I told the manager I left my iPod right here on the bagel stand, and it should still be here. I told her I want to see camera footage from the cameras. There was a higher up manager who worked at a different location who had access to them so she said she’ll call her. Once the “baker” heard me demand the video from the camera. She was acting so nice towards me, cracking jokes, etc. it was WEIRD, I could tell she was guilty as hell. The baker had to go to her other jobs at Starbucks around 12pm, so she left before I was able to hear about the footage, 2 hour laters the district manager said, the baker had pocket my itouch in the morning after she had opened. The district manager called Starbucks and told she had until 4pm to come by and give me my itouch back or she’ll call the cops on her. She comes in at 4pm, apologizing to me and LITERALLY CRYING saying she was gonna give it back to me and she’s sorry. She got fired on the spot and that’s the last I ever heard of her :)',\n",

Back in the mid 2000s, my ex had a white 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse, his baby. He was at the mall, walking back out to the parking lot when he sees a little red 2 door hatchback park next to his car. When the guys open the doors, they hit his car. Then, because it’s a two door, the guy in the backseat slams open the same door, hitting his car harder. They proceed to walk off laughing, ignoring the guy playing on his phone walking past them. When he gets to his car, there’s a red dent in his door. \\n\\nAs an aside, my ex was at his peak in tae kwon do at the time. He was working out daily and was being trained to represent his school. \\n\\nSo he pulls his car out, parks it, returns and back kicks their door in. There was a visible foot print inside the dent. He then calmly goes back to his car and takes off. I wish I’d been with him at the time because my petty ass would’ve left a note saying “Thanks for the dent, I left you one.” I also wish I’d seen their faces when they got back to their car.

We rent, I know the owner of the house, not a big deal that two supports are broken and it\\'s leaning.  I was gonna put a small support in because we\\'re moving soon and the owner doesn\\'t mind either.  \\n\\nMy pregnant wife, child and I go over to clean our car and install a new car seat on level ground.  Que rude ass fucking owner in big black ford f150, stickers everywhere, looks like Tom Cruise in Days of Thunder with a shitty mustache.  He comes over after watching us for a minute, asks if there\\'s a problem, all while getting closer to us.  I politely let him know where installing a new car seat.  \"No you\\'re not, you need to get out of here\" he said rude as fuck.  I give him a \"yeah ok\" and finish, we drive off.\\n\\nWe checked the ratings at that carwash and it\\'s happened a hand full of times before.  The owner has been rude and even followed people.\\n\\nI called code enforcement to let them know of the dilapidated, leaning, broken splinted fence with the screws and nails sticking out.  Huge safety concern.  They are going to serve him to fix it.  He has a month or he goes to court.\\n\\nTLDR:. Car wash owner was rude, now he has to replace the fence.',\n",

Being winter in Canada, she took it with her on the school bus and shared it with her friends. By the time they arrived at school, they all had swollen, numb lips and watering eyes. She was not amused. \\nAs it was the 80s, my brother had a love affair with Final Net hairspray. The kind that you pump out like a fire extinguisher. His hair was a crystallised edifice that could withstand gale force winds. He is native and has very thick, very black hair. \\n\\nMy sister topped up the bottle with hydrogen peroxide. \\nOver the course of a few weeks (and a few more top ups), his hair started to slowly turn orange. It was so gradual that you didn’t notice until it was all you could see. \\nWe kept our lips zipped and it eventually grew out. \\nI found out decades later that my mother actually took him to medical specialists trying to find out what was going on. 😆',\n",

As he was passing a shop he noticed a kid (maybe 12 years old) throwing a tantrum and calling his mother rude names and swearing. As the mother turned around to go to the into the shop to buy something, he approached. Now, my uncle is 6 foot tall and had long black hair and a beard so he must have looked like a bear walking over to this little kid. He pulled down his sunglasses just enough for his red eyes to be seen and whispered 'Don't let me see you treating your mother like that again young man; I'll be watching you'. The kid looked frightened and ran into the store to go find his mother. Just as he thought his job was done my uncle saw them walk out of the shop, the child already acting up again. When the kid saw my uncle standing there watching him he immediately his behind his mother and stopped acting up. As they were walking away my uncle took a shortcut to get Infront of them and keep an eye on the kid. Sure enough as soon as the kid thought he was safe he started swearing and yelling again. My uncle just lowered his glasses and glared at the kid who jumped out of his skin upon noticing that my uncle had just appeared in front of them. The child immediately hugged his mother and whispered 'i love you mummy' while still looking into my uncles eyes like he was going to wet himself. My uncle then decided his job was done and walked home.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I was at a flea market yesterday browsing around when I came across a booth selling guns and ammo.  The booth was ran by an older man and woman, probably in their 60s. This is not unusual for flea markets to have someone selling guns but the other thing they were selling was. On the other table they had 11 packages of bottle rockets which is illegal in my state plus unless you are a licensed dealer/manufacturer of fireworks there are only certain days per year which you could sell. Normally I wouldn't care what they was selling but  they had a had a sign printed up that pissed me off. The sign read: *Biden/Harris supporters need not shop here! If you supported them, you are too dumb and irresponsible to own a gun.*  I have never understood why a business wants to alienate potential customers just to make their political beliefs public. So being a responsible citizen, I decided to call the police and report them for selling illegal fireworks. \\n\\n20 minutes goes by and as I'm about to leave a cop car pulls in and stops behind the booth. The cop gets out and makes his way over to the table. He begins talking to the women (I don't know what they said since I was too far to hear) but after about 10 minutes he pulls out his ticket book and writes a ticket  and confiscates the bottle rockets. After the cop leaves, I walk down the aisle past their booth, her face was a red as fire as she and the man we're loading everything up in their truck. Gotta say I felt good after this.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I've really wanted to watch Raya and the Last Dragon recently especially because of the asian representation and the fact that some of my friends worked on the movie. I live with two friends so I thought we could split the price and pay $10 each to watch it, but one of my friends is refusing to pay saying Disney is charging too much even though we would've payed $15+ each to see it in theaters anyway. Oh and he also makes the most money out of all of us.\\n\\nHowever, my apartment also uses my family's Disney+, Netflix and HBO Max accounts to watch most of our TV and movies including Star Wars the Clone Wars, WandaVision, the Mandalorian, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Justice League Snyder Cut, Godzilla vs Kong, etc. Most of these shows are even Disney and he watches them for free while my family pays. So you know what I just did literally 10 min ago? I signed out of all the accounts. \\n\\nI can watch all the shows on my laptop in the meantime so I'm not missing out on much although I do feel a little bad for my 3rd roommate who is stuck as collateral damage. We'll see if he thinks that $10 was worth losing the $30+/month of free subscription services.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I play online poker for free chips on a certain Russian based platform where there are a whole range of emoji type symbols and images you can send one another, some quite rude. It\\'s very common for disputes to break out and for people to send dogs, cats, roosters, pigs, donkeys etc to each other. Also mean text messages but you can\\'t swear or you get a ban. You can also send monkeys, clown hats and all kinds of other stuff. Lots of it is nice, but others are either nasty or misused to call people names. \\n\\nYesterday I joined a table with 500m chip buy in, but chose to play the smallest amount on the table I could, which is 100m. Well, one of the other players, apparently a woman, didn\\'t appreciate that and started slagging me off. I told her to wrecked but she persisted so it devolved into a slanging match. Now some of these emojis are expensive in that they cost in game coins, but then when you send them the person can either accept or reject the gift but you still see the symbol move across the screen from your icon to theirs. One of these is a poop icon which literally looks like a coil with a smiley face on it. So at a certain point I said \"open your mouth\" and then carried on typing something else, with the intention of sending the poop symbol right after. As i finished and was about to send the poop symbol, the other player goes \"Ahhhhhhhh\". The timing was perfect. There are also animations to show thumbs up, boredom, anger, sadness and laughter, and of course I hit the laughing button to try rub it in.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Until the completion of my project last year I spent 18 months in a project team building the national hq for a well known international company. Our project director M was brought in for his experience on jobs this scale. J was our project manager and has been with us for almost 10 years. J is very good at what he does and by the end every really knew that J was the one who captained our ship. \\n\\nM is smart but also narcissistic and likes to abuse people and throw them under the bus. I was the only other person in the project team that like J, had been at the company for enough years to have earned respect from senior management and have the confidence to bark back that M wouldn't ever verbally have a go at me in person.\\n\\nTurns out that despite M being smart, he clearly big big noted himself to get the job and his skillset was  wrong for the team which meant he got found out eventually. During covid and the project entering its last 2-3 M spent less time in the office. Each night I'd be there late and I kept eyeing off his pile of spare office shirts he'd wear when he cycled in.\\n\\nOne night after debating withself I concluded that I was sick of his petty emails and seeing him abuse my colleagues. I took a box cutter and carefully sliced off a button or 2 on each shirt. Once I had cut off these buttons I proceeded to slice off all the spare buttons each shirt had ensuring there was no convenient replacement. \\n\\nM probably came into the office a handful more times before being tapped on the shoulder and told his services were no longer needed. I took great pleasure watching him pack up his belongings and eyeballed him the whole time. Fair to say he didn't acknowledge me once.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I was out running an errand just depositing some cash when this absolute piss baby decided to act like he was 5. I was going to a drive thru ATM, and to get there I was driving through part of the parking lot (literally the only way to get to it is through said lot). As I was entering from one part of the lot, I saw some other dude driving to the same place. I drive out into the entrance before him, but we had a decent amount of space between us, so it was not as if I just cut him off while entering the line. What does he do in response? Honk like a fucking maniac, not once, not twice, just aggressively hits that shit like his life depended on it. \\n\\nThere was a small line at the ATM itself (including me, 3 cars in front of the piss baby), but that wasn’t awful for what it could’ve been. This guy was not having that though, I saw him looking absolutely IRATE in my rearview, and then he promptly and quite aggressively, pulled out and FLOORED it out of the ATM line. Thats the last of that right? NOPE! Dude fucking comes back into the line looking annoyed as hell. He then proceeds to look like he was popping OFF at me, and even started sneering and making faces, like come on are you a child dude? Note, I am a 20 yo woman, this guy looks like he’s in his 40’s. \\n\\nI get running errands and having a bad day and maybe he was in a rush, but like shit man just grumble be annoyed but if you act like a little piss baby, then get ready for me to be petty cause I was NOT having it. The two cars in-front of me finished up pretty quick, but I had other plans. I was in no particular rush and I had to deposit 20 some bills. Like most ATM machines you can just stick a wad of bills in and it reads them, but I decided to feed the machine each bill ***individually***. This of course prompts me on the screen to either add more bills or finish deposit each time, which adds on a good minute or two of me being there. This didn’t take horrendously long so I didn’t delay him that badly, but I know that every second counts to someone who clearly can’t be bothered to wait. \\n\\nThe most glorious moment is when I made eye contact with him through my mirror, he was sitting there very clearly steaming and annoyed at the wait, and I just had the biggest shit eating grin. He probably couldn't see it but it was enough for me that he was pissed. To whomever that guy is, fuck you, I hope those 2 extra minutes ruined that part of your day you absolute piss baby.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I was told this belongs here, so here goes!\\n\\nFor context;\\nI live on the ground floor of an apartment building, with a parking lot outside my bedroom window and a tree right next to it as well. My computer desk is next to the window, and on nice days I often have it open . We also have black-out screens that allow us to see out, however you can\\'t see in from the outside unless you really go out of your way to.\\n\\nI have a Corgi. If you\\'re acquainted with the breed, you know that Corgis are generally very vocal dogs that are a big dog in a small dog\\'s body. They aren\\'t squeaky like most small dogs and have a \"big dog bark.\" Winston is no exception but is pretty well trained and will generally hush or bark on command. \\n\\nYesterday I was at my desk with the window open as usual and I noticed a man with two kids walking through the parking lot to go around the building. The little girl was holding dad\\'s hand, but the boy of about 7-8ish was running ahead. \\n\\nWinston heard them and let out a little bark. I shushed him and went back to playing my game. \\n\\nThe boy heard my dog though and came really close to my window. He was pressing his face to the screen and yelled \"I can\\'t see it!\" back at his dad. \\n\\nBeing less than 3ft from the window, this made me super uncomfortable. The kid started to cup his hands to the window, which would have allowed him to really be able to see in through the blackout screen. I generally don\\'t like kids, I like quiet and privacy, and even though my window was open I was feeling pretty invaded. \\n\\nI looked at Winston sitting next to me and in the lowest whisper I could said \"Get em.\"\\nWinston is not mean or aggressive in any sense of the word but \"Get em\" is his go word for \"Bark at them real big time and don\\'t stop until you\\'re told to\" \\n\\nWinston lives for two things; barking and herding our cat. This was his time to shine. He didn\\'t waste a second and immediately started barking at the window as big and loud as his little lungs let him. He jumped up on the windowsill and was basically barking directly into this kid\\'s face from inches away. \\n\\nThe kid started shrieking, stumbled backwards and tripped over the same tree root that has made me eat dirt a few times. He went down on his butt pretty hard and started bawling. The dad yelled \"Stay out of people\\'s windows then!!!\" and dragged him off. \\n\\nWinston barked until they were completely out of sight and we could still hear the kid crying until they were indoors. \\n\\nI felt a little bad for the kid and petty for what I did but at the same time, he had it coming. X\\'D \\n\\nHere\\'s a big fat album of dog tax! He really likes giving us the stink-eye. \\nhttp://imgur.com/a/uUFUci9',\n",

He was driving one day down a street that had cars parked on both sides leaving only one lane open in the middle.  There was a car stopped in this lane as the driver had his window open and was speaking to a friend who was standing in the street beside the car.  He stopped and waited for a minute with the expectation that he was seen and that either the conversation would end or the car would pull to the side of the road in a open space or in front of a driveway.  \\n\\nCar didn't move so he he gave a short beep on his horn.  The guy in the street turned and looked at him and then said something to the other driver.  Car still didn't move.  After a short wait he gave a longer beep on his horn.  Guy in the street indicated to his friend that he should move the car but again driver decided to continue the conversation right where they were.\\n\\nAt this point he had had enough.  Stopped car was regular sized sedan and he was driving a beat up station wagon (I said this happened years ago, you can Google 'station wagon').  So he drove right up to the stopped car until bumpers were practically touching.  Still no response from other driver.  So he started to move forward and push the other car.  Once he got it moving he continued pushing until he forced the other car across a T intersection, over the curb, and into a lawn.  He backed away and then continued on his drive.  As far as anyone knows he never got in trouble for this.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'My brother has always been a super hard worker but he also has a temper.  In his teens, he was promoted to manager of a local BBQ chain that has a few stores around the south in the U.S. (It still has great BBQ and fantastic hot fudge cake dessert).\\n\\nThe store he managed was the very first one and had only been open for a couple of years.  It was located in a small town in the southern part of the Tennessee Valley, much like those quaint towns you see in Hallmark movies, except with more curvy roads.  In fact, the BBQ place was located just past a blind curve that, if you did not know where it was, you would miss the parking lot and have to turn around.  \\n\\nThis town was also close to the corporate headquarters of a Dairy farm famous for its ice cream, milk, and gigantic plastic cow mascot.  The dairy would take this massive, 14 ft. plastic cow to various gas stations, restaurants, grocery stores, anyplace its brand was sold to promote their merchandise.  They would bring the cow on a trailer and usually leave it for a while.  One of those places was, you guessed it, the BBQ place my brother managed.  Unfortunately, the cow would only fit in one spot, at the edge of the parking lot.  Anyone driving through would come around the blind curve only to be confronted with the magnificent view of this giant plastic cow\\'s butt.   This did not set well with several residents of this small town so they called to complain, several times a day.  \\n\\nMy brother couldn\\'t move the cow, he didn\\'t have any tools that could move it.  He tried contacting the dairy place but they refused to come and get it as well.  I am not entirely sure why they wouldn\\'t come get their cow but I imagine after several days of hearing customer complaints, my brother was less than friendly with them on the phone.  \\n\\nI think that cow sat in that parking lot for two weeks before my brother got fed up and exacted his revenge.  One night after closing my brother took a ladder, climbed as high as he could, and spread hot fudge cake all down the backend of this cow.  This was super moist cake too so it stuck like glue.  His reasoning: \"If they are going to complain anyway, I\\'m going to give them something to complain about.\"\\n\\nNot long after that incident the dairy came and got their cow.',\n",

This is relevant later. \\n\\nA woman comes up to the register and has this massive pile of clothes, no problem of course and I start to scan her stuff and make small talk. After scanning all of her clothes her bill racks up to around $400. At that point I let her know the end sale price and she hands over a credit card that clearly doesn\\'t have her name on it (it was something like Michael), so I tell her that she\\'ll have to provide ID as per the company policy. You can see then she gets agitated and says she doesn\\'t have an ID to provide because the card is under her husbands name. I say \"Oh okay I\\'m sorry ma\\'am I cannot accept this form of purchase would you happen to have another one?\" At that point she starts to freak out, she asked me if her husband can provide proof over the phone and I say no. That\\'s when she decides to go NUTS, she screams at me and then shoves the massive amount of clothes over the counter, flips me off and storms out of the store.\\n\\nMy coworkers all came over and asked if I was okay to which I said yes but that I needed to have some jump on register for me.\\n\\nA few hours later the lady comes back with her husband demanding all of the clothes that she had earlier as it was usual for us to just throw our \"go backs\" into a basket near us and put it back at the end of the day. This is where my revenge comes in. \\n\\nSee, when I jumped off of register earlier that day it wasn\\'t to compose myself, it was so that I could ***put back*** all of the clothes she threw over the counter at me so that when she came back (they **always** do) she had to go look for it all over again. When she came back she had to stand in line for a **super** long time only for her to then greet me with a \"Where are my clothes at? I went to pick up my husband since ID\\'ing is apparently so important here.\" (While rolling her eyes) I reply with these sweet words, \"Oh ma\\'am unfortunately all of the clothes that you picked out have been put back onto the racks. You\\'ll have to spend some time looking for them again unfortunately.\" she looked like she wanted to strangle me but she walked away because her husband came in and said \"No problem thank you!\" Poor guy was probably so embarrassed. \\n\\nSeeing that woman\\'s face when I told her it had all been put back was euphoric to me, and seeing her take another two hours picking it all out again was even better.',\n",

There was this group of really annoying girls that would shit on people for how they looked, They made rumors about others, And made fun of others including me. But one girl was the main instigator. There was this particular day where I was not doing so well and I was stressed and angry, And she was taunting me at school saying how fat and “crusty” I was. When I went home, She even sent me a text message  making fun of me and even calling me a “racist” She made up a rumor which ended up getting me cancelled at school. Luckily the principal was not involved, nor my parents. This was the last straw, Me and my friend were done with her bullshit so we edited a text message she sent and made it say homophobic and racist things, We then sent it to her friends and people at our school, Everybody believed me, Including her twin sister. She became an outcast, Nobody talked to her, And I taunted her in the hallway the next day',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So a little bit of background: this happened late summer/early autumn of last year. I work at a chain clothing store (the name of which rhymes with bold gravy) which, in response to the pandemic, has expanded our online shopping options. You can buy online and pick up in store for no charge, but you have to present either an ID or email receipt when you pick it up. This legally covers our asses and also ensures we don’t give your package to someone who isn’t you. All of this information will be relevant. \\n\\nSo I was working a closing shift and it was about 8pm. I’m folding clothes to the side of the store when a customer (who I will refer to as Karen, despite that not being her name) walks up to me and says she needs to pick up an order. \\n\\n“No problem! I’ll take care of that for you right over here.” \\n\\nI walk Karen over to our online pickup stand (section of the store where the online orders are waiting to be picked up) and ask for her name. As we’re walking over she mentions that she actually has two separate orders to pick up (this will also be relevant later). She gives me her name and I grab her packages, then open prepare to check her out. \\n\\nNow, company protocol is that we absolutely cannot give an order to a customer without them providing either ID or the email receipt. So, like I’ve done dozens of times before, I ask her for that without even looking up as I finish checking her package out. \\n\\n“I didn’t have to provide that last time.”\\n\\nI look up. What she said is either bullshit or someone at another store ignoring policy. Either way, doesn’t matter. \\n\\n“I’m sorry, ma’am. It’s company policy.”\\n\\n“I left it in my car and I don’t want to walk all the way back out there.”\\n\\n“Ma’am, it’s company policy. There’s nothing I can do.”\\n\\nThis is the point at which Karen shows her true colors. She screams at me, and I quote, “Well then you have shove it!” and flips me off before stomping out like a three year old. I just stood there for a moment in complete shock. The combination of the rate of escalation (the situation went from 0 to nuclear in about 15 seconds) and the sheer absurdity just absolutely stunned me. Fortunately my mask hid my open jaw.\\n\\nAbout 30 seconds after Karen stormed out another customer (who was an absolute delight!) came up to me and we shared a silent moment of What The Fuck Just Happened. She needed to pick up an order as well and unlike Karen was perfectly happy to show ID. We had a nice exchange and she went on her way. \\n\\nNow my manager Andrea comes over (obviously not her real name). Andrea knows me and knows I wouldn’t fuck up on a galactic scale like Karen seemed to think. Anyway, after I finished with Not Asshole Customer, Andrea came up to me and asked me what had happened with Karen. I explained and right as I was finishing, Andrea gets a call on the store phone. \\n\\nHere’s where the petty revenge comes in. \\n\\nIt is, of course, Karen. Having not picked up her packages due to her temper tantrum, she now wants an employee to bring them out to her car (standard stuff, we do this about half a dozen times a day). So I put on the reflective vest, grab her packages, and go out to her car. She rolls down her window and is obviously pissed that it’s me delivering the packages.\\n\\n“May I see your ID?” I say through my most shit-eating grin. \\n\\nShe huffs and puffs enough to blow down a house but hands it over. I look at it, confirm it’s her, and then hand it back. Then, on a whim, I say,\\n\\n“I’m sorry, I need to see it again.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Two packages. Sorry, it’s company policy.”\\n\\nNow, this is complete bullshit. I only needed to see it once. I just wanted to piss her off. \\n\\n“No it’s not!”\\n\\nI shrug.\\n\\n“Sorry. Company policy.”\\n\\nShe huffs and puffs some more but hands it over. I glance down at it and then hand it back with her packages.\\n\\n“Have a nice day!”\\n\\n\\nTl;dr entitled Karen doesn’t want to believe our store policy and refuses to believe that I really do need to see her ID. I end up seeing it anyway after she throws a tantrum.',\n",

       "  'selftext': '(Mobile)\\n\\nSo I work at a pizza shop (not gonna specify because I do still work there) and I have been a closing manager for a while. My tasks are pretty simple when it\\'s only me as manager closing: clean stretch table, clean make line, clean cut table, clean front counter, end of day paperwork. When there\\'s another manager I handle stretch and all the paper work.\\n\\nWell, it was just me this night. I had sent my closing driver home because he said he finished everything and said he double checked (dishes, empty sinks, empty cleaning buckets, trash, sweep/mop). I start going back over everything and notice some spots he misses. I go back over and sweep them. Then notice he didn\\'t do all the dishes. Then he didn\\'t put things away. And the list just kept getting bigger...\\n\\nNow at this point, I\\'m thinking to myself, \"well shit... I got an hour left to do the end of day stuff. Well I\\'ll do the best I can while staying within time.\" So I get things good enough and finish out all the paperwork and get out around 11:39pm. Now, yes, I could\\'ve done better, but I was ready to go home. It was almost 12 and I still hadn\\'t eaten all day. So I go home and don\\'t think anything of it.\\n\\nTHE NEXT DAY!!!!! I do my job like a good little boy. And after everything is said and done, the other manager tells me to head to the office. The GM/DM had written me up!\\n\\nNow I saved this part for last, because this\\'ll be a good kick in the balls later for them. About a week ago we had corporate come by and tell us we were one of the highest ranked stores in the south (something like 3/601. Not sure though). The only thing we needed to work on was getting out of here on time. Aka: 20 minutes after we close... Nani the fuck!?!?! 20 minutes!?!?! With 2 people, max!?!?\\n\\nBut, heeyyyy... I got a write up for the store not being clean. So, I\\'ll play along. I\\'ll stay there aaaaaall night to get the store clean. I\\'ll scrub every little nook and cranny so their happy. \\n\\n(TL:DR) Write me up because it\\'s not clean, even though you\\'re pressuring me to get done in a specific amount of time? I\\'ll disregard your time and get your store clean, even if it takes all night.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Long sorry-\\nThis started in November 2019-\\nMy daughter works at a huge chicken place where they say “my pleasure”.  She was front of house lead one Saturday and I stopped by to grab food for the family. As I was waiting for my food there was a line out the door and a registered opened up and the lady (OL) at the front of line would not move. Cashier called to her and OL just stood there. The guy behind her assuming she didn’t see or hear the cashier pointed the open space to OL. Cashier smiled and waved. OL made a face and an extremely racist comment very loudly. You could have heard a pin drop. Everyone stopped and stared. My daughter stood shocked for a moment then remembered she was in charge so she walked around and stood in front of OL and calmly explained this is a privately owned restaurant and there were lots of children present.  My daughter did not yell, but she didn’t blink either she stared OL in the eye. “You need to leave none of my team will be serving you today”\\nCustomers actually cleared a path to the door. OL doubled down and started screaming horrible names at my daughter, who didn’t blink (all the staring contests with her brothers had prepared her for this moment). When my daughter refused to yell back OL spit in her face. Now I was about to unleash mama bear when the owner came out. He showed OL a printout from the camera system of her face and a list then said “ma’am I own 12 restaurants here in town, here is a full list and this copy of the photo that all of my employees will hav burned into their brains. Consider yourself banned from any establishment I own. Also if my employee chooses I will call the police.”  My daughter declined, and the lady left. Fast forward to 2020 and lockdown. Take out and delivery only. OL has been trying to get service at several of the restaurants on the list and have been denied several times (couple of times new people served her). She thought that with drive up surly they would serve her now- well now they have personal information and decline orders made by her online, on apps, and even if she drives up. My daughter gave the Cashier the pleasure of walking up to OL’s car in the curbside and handing her money back. Even adding “Have a nice day ma’am” I think that was the best petty revenge. \\nMoral- be nice to people uh who can feed you, they have long memories.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Back 20 years ago I got a summer factory job to earn some money before college at a local factory doing production labor as a temporary non union employee. I got the job due to knowing someone in the front office. \\n\\nSo they put me infront of a machine to run 8 hours a day all day long. It was pretty easy. Put the part into the machine, press a few buttons, wait a couple mintues until the part was done, move it to a different machine, ream the holes out, then stack on a pallet. Took about 10 minutes per part to finish. Once the pallet was full I moved it to another machine 10 feet away for another operator to do the other process. \\n\\nBeing a 18 year old i got bored standing around waiting and waiting. So I sped up the process not just doing one part through the whole process one at a time. Instead while process one was running I was doing process 2 when process one was running. Seems like this would be how it should have been done but it was a union shop and they got paid by the hour so they didn\\'t care how many they finished. \\n\\nAfter a few weeks i was able to double the production the machine center was outputting and it did not go unnoticed by the non union management and the union production employees. Management told me to keep up the good work and the union side told me to slow down. People would try and mess with me by hiding my tools or putting oil or other stuff inside my gloves to get back at me. It didnt work it just made me work harder. I started taking my breaks at the machines and keep them running with out stopping production.\\n\\n\\nSo there was a backlog of parts now growning at the next machine center. The union decided they could slow me down by having to run one machine center the first 4 hrs of the shift snd then have me run the other machine center the last 4hrs.\\nPETTY REVENGE TIME\\nAfter a few weeks of this i got the bright i could run both machine centers at the same time doing the job of basically 2 people at once doubling the output. I ran my ass off but the nights went by quick. Since i was always at my machines they couldnt do anything to me without me noticing. Summer break was almost done and i put my 2 weeks notice in to the relief of the union guys. \\nSo my last day was coming up on friday and my boss pulled me into his office and thanked me for the hard work this summer. He asked if i could do him one last favor before i left. \"Sure boss what is it\". \"I need you to come in tomorrow four hours early to work the last half of days shift and the first half of second shift to show the union guys how to run both machine centers at once\". \\nOh man they were pissed.  Now they had to run both centers at the same time. \\nTL/DR\\nSummer job in union shop. Kept busy to make night go quicker. Double production.  Union not happy. They tried to mess with me to slow me down. Backfired. Did the job of 2 union guys. Management had me show they how to do both jobs before I left to go to college.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This story comes to me secondhand from both the manager in the story and my friend who happened to be there.\\n\\nOne of the managers at my local gun store is a loud, hardass, ex-marine who has a short temper. He\\'s exactly the kind of guy you\\'re thinking of, conservative, brash, forward, conspiratorial, in your face. The kind of guy who if you asked the question \"How was your morning?\" he\\'d respond, \"Well there\\'s new construction on my street which made it hard to get to work probably because the Democrats want to make it impossible for me to sell guns\", yeah, that guy. He\\'s loud, political, and annoying but he is never boring.\\n\\nSo the manager is at the gun store and this customer calls up in a rage. This customer is furious because she ordered a gun online and there is some problem between the gun being shipped from the manufacturer to the store. He tried to get the necessary information from her to contact the manufacturer but in her rage she refuses to give it to him. Finally after a half an hour of going back and forth, she relents and gives him the information he needs. He gets ahold of the manufacturer, and the gun is shipped in.\\n\\nAs you can imagine, when she came to pick up the gun, she wasn\\'t any nicer. In return, the manager wasn\\'t nice back. Gun store employees generally aren\\'t nice in the first place. In America, when you want to buy a gun from a store, you have to fill out a long government form called a 4473 with lots of questions to answer and dates to mark and signatures to make, etc. Usually when you fill one out store employees will usually guide you through each question to make sure everything is filled in appropriately. Instead, the manager watched her fill out the form going \"that\\'s wrong\", \"you missed that\", \"you didn\\'t do that right\", just to make her even more mad. After pissing her off even more, she finishes the form.\\n\\nWhen it comes time to pay she walks up to the front counter but instead of her paying, her husband takes out his credit card. That is a problem. You see, in filling out that 4473, you put yourself as the owner of the gun, however, if her husband was paying, and it could be construed that he would be the actual owner of the gun, which would be illegal since he wasn\\'t the one that filled out the form. Sometimes gun store employees won\\'t care about this if it\\'s the same party, they were married after all, but the manager decided to be a dick about it. He told her that her husband could not pay because that would be a straw purchase. She throws a fit but after getting nothing out of the manager, she relents and pulls out her own credit card.\\n\\nJust as she is about to make the purchase, the manager asks the couple \"If he was going to buy it, why isn\\'t he the one filling out the form and taking ownership of the gun?\", \"Oh, I\\'m a felon\" the husband said. Yeah, that\\'s right, the husband, who tried to pay for the gun, had been convicted of a felony in the past. As you may have guessed, felons cannot buy guns. The manager lights up and says that because it\\'s pretty obvious that the husband, a convicted felon, is going to be the recipient of the gun, and that this was a straw purchase. So the manager goes to cancel the sale. The husband says \"Oh it was just a minor thing, I was only in for three years\". The manager said it didn\\'t matter, a felony is a felony, and he could not buy the gun. The wife goes ballistic, but there\\'s nothing she could do. They ended up leaving the store empty handed and the gun had to be sent back to the manufacturer.\\n\\nDon\\'t be a dick if you don\\'t have to.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I (31F) live in an apartment that, while there is green space around, faces the parking lot. My wife and I have two cars and one garage spot, so I park my car in the surface lot.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have not been driving my car much or at all because I am working from home, and my family is very strict about staying home right now because we have to go on a trip in April. Still, it is in a spot close to my apartment door because there have been car breakins and I want to watch it.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of my neighbors complained last weekend to the property manager that my car smelled funny (it doesn’t, I confirmed this with an outside party), so I should move it farther away from the building. Then, she upped the ante yesterday by claiming my car smells like gasoline and I need to move it *right now* because the smell is getting into her apartment.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have never smelled anything, and I took my car to the mechanic to have it checked (thanks for the bill, Karen!) There are no faults or problems to cause a smell, it is not dangerous, the mechanic didn’t know what she was talking about.\\n\\n\\n\\nI concluded that this woman is lying because either she wants the close space for herself, she doesn’t like me for some reason, she’s on a power trip, and/or she’s homophobic. I am moving in June.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, commence where I (and my wife) are petty. We got the car back as quickly as we could and parked it next to the neighbor’s car, which had of course taken over the closest spot. My wife plans to also move her car to park in one of the “good” spots too.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust now, I saw that the petty neighbor and her car(s) were gone, so I ran out and moved my car to the closest spot. There is no problem with it, and if my neighbor is going to be petty and I’m about to give notice, I’ll play. I literally can see the parking wars and have every opportunity to move my car, since I WFH.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd guess what, bitch? Since you made a baseless complaint and cost me at the mechanic and goodwill with the property management, I am leaving my car in the prime spot in a few weeks when I go to Hawaii to deal with estate stuff.\\n\\n\\nFor 10 days, possibly more if I have a COVID scare. Wife is coming too. Cat sitter drives over. So, three cars taking up all the prime spots you wanted so badly as to get me on trouble for.\\n\\n\\n\\nMahalo nui nui, bitch. Aloha.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy wife has been referring to this stuff as “the petty-mobile conflict.”',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I work in a small office and next door in the same building we have a Curves gym. At first everything was fine until they decided \"Hey! We\\'re gonna claim these parking spots for ourselves!\" and stuck signs in front of the spaces closest to the entrance. We were like \"Ok, our company owns the building, but y\\'all are old so fine. Wish we could\\'ve gotten a heads up though.\"\\n\\nFlash forward a few months and these old bats ARE PARKING IN \"OUR\" SPOTS IN THE BACK OF THE LOT WHEN THEY HAVE PERFECTLY OPEN SPOTS IN THE FRONT. Strike #1\\n\\nMaybe this means they no longer care if we park up front? Yeah... no.\\n\\nA few days ago one of my favorite coworkers noticed a small note taped to the windshield of her car saying \"You cannot park here. Please move -Curves Management\". Oddly enough she had been parking there the last few months with NO ISSUE BEFORE So that was Strike #2\\n\\nStrike 3:\\n\\nI leave for lunch and come back to find ONE OF THOSE OLD BATS CARS IN MY SPOT WHEN THEIR FRONT IS WIDE OPEN.\\n\\nI really cannot think of a better example of hypocrisy than this right now. My manager has mentioned it before, but she doesn\\'t want to full on confront them because she says it would look bad on the company\\'s owners. So what do I do?\\n\\nThe revenge:\\n\\nYou see, us and Curves share a break room and 2 bathrooms and about a year ago they suddenly started claiming that one of the bathrooms is for women\\'s use only. (It was a 1 stall bathroom. Literally nobody cared about this until they decided to and I\\'m pretty sure that was just their way of claiming it as their own). \\n\\nWelp, Every time I go to the back room I make sure to turn on \"Their bathroom\\'s\" light and shut the door completely to simulate someone being in there. Not sure about y\\'all, but I myself am not comfortable knocking on bathroom doors if I think another person is in there. I can\\'t do much in terms of revenge right now because my manager wants to wait to bring it up with the owners on their next visit, but I can do this much at least!\\n\\nI HOPE I INCONVIENCE/ANNOY/BOTHER THE SHIT OUT OF YOU OLD BATS',\n",

It\\'s rude as fuck and I really don\\'t understand how these people aren\\'t super embarrassed by their behavior. Especially when it\\'s a place like a lunch break room at work where people are trying to have a moment of peace in their work day. Like this:\\n\\nOn to the story: I was on my lunch break yesterday in the teeny tiny break room (important to note that it is small) One other lady was in there. Suddenly she is FaceTiming her husband or some shit idk who but her tinny speakers blasting his annoying voice at full volume while she yells into the phone talking about \"show me the view!!\" \\n\\nI normally would say some shit like, \"hey could you please turn that down?\" But I don\\'t like confrontation and only had like five minutes left in my break anyways so instead I let out two very large, silent, and smelly farts and left her in the break room with them while she was eating:) \\n\\nI could smell them start to fumigate as I was walking out so I knew they were stinkers.  \\n\\nWalked out with a smile on my face and a new post for Reddit.😈',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'When I was working as a barista, there were two nights a week the closers would have to sweep and mop the entire coffeehouse, supposedly in 15 minutes. This is was impossible to do so I would do what I could throughout the evening and do the rest once everyone was gone, often going over on time.\\n\\nThere was a lady who started coming in a few hours before close, and she\\'d drag her poor dog in too. She would just ask for hot water (free) with the excuse that she didn\\'t like any of our 50 bajillion teas. She would use a tea bag she brought from home. I don\\'t remember why we let her stay tbh (once we started cracking down on the fact that to use our wifi you have to order something she made a scene and stopped coming in). A couple times she\\'d order something and then complain that it wasn\\'t good. But she always took advantage of many many hot water refills (important later).\\n\\nEvery night I would announce closing. Like clockwork, she would take her sweet damn time packing everything up, and then head for the bathrooms. Every night we would finish and be ready to leave and she\\'d still be in there. And on Sweep-and-Mop nights, I couldn\\'t lock everything up and mop until she was gone. It made my blood boil. We were not paid to be there that long, and it was almost midnight. #ServiceWorkersAreNotPaidEnoughForThis\\n\\nSo I started announcing 15 min ahead of time that we were closing in 15. It made no difference. I tried asking her directly- It didn\\'t work. \"Yah yah I\\'m packing up\" - take her time then straight to the bathroom. I turned the music off abruptly. I turned the music up too loud. I turned lights off. Still, she\\'d wait until the last possible second and then head for the bathroom.\\n\\nI am not a confrontational person, and I was less of one then. I hate conflict. But she\\'d pushed me to my breaking point AND she was a jerk. One night I snapped.\\n\\nI made my 15 min-to-close announcement. Come close, I blocked off the bathrooms for \"cleaning.\" I made my announcement. Music off. Most lights off. I started putting tables and chairs up for the mop. \\n\\nShe took like ten minutes to get up from the table. Full of free hot water, she headed for the bathroom hallway. In my cheeriest customer service voice I said, \"sorry, bathrooms are closed for cleaning, the floors are still wet. We\\'re closed.\" \\n\\nFull-of-water lady: \"But I need to use the bathroom!\"\\n\\nMe: \"Sorry, we closed ten minutes ago.\"\\n\\nFull-of-water lady: I drank a lot of tea I need to use the bathroom!\"\\n\\nMe: \"Sorry, we closed ten minutes ago.\"\\n\\nFull-of-water lady: \"What am I supposed to do?\"\\n\\nMe: \"I\\'m sorry, we\\'re closed\"\\n\\nFull-of-water lady: \\\\*dumps the contents of her dog\\'s water cup on the floor and walks out\\\\*\\n\\nI felt bad immediately bc where would she pee? The parking lot? But she never pulled that shit on anyone in our shop again.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Senior year of high school. Last school dance of the year. I\\'m (17M) in line to take pictures with my date, and a girl comes up, sticks her gum in my hair, and runs away.\\n\\nFor context, I barely knew this girl. I was...not \"popular,\" but visible on campus because I was involved in virtually every club, including  our debate club (that\\'s how she knew me, I think). A lot of people found me annoying, probably because I was always taking contrarian viewpoints that pissed people off, sometimes just to get a rise out of people. I guess this girl was nursing a special animus. She must have planned the attack, because she had a few \"flankers\" who didn\\'t participate but knew what was about to go down. As soon as I was gummed down, they all ran to the door in case they needed to make a quick escape. But they lingered to savor my embarrassment.\\n\\nPeople around me start to react. I guess she got me pretty good. No way it will come out in time for the pictures. A few of my female friends start to get worked up. \"OMG what did she do?\" \"Where\\'d she go?\" etc. Feels like the drama is about to escalate.\\n\\nBut I see her standing in the doorway, watching me, waiting to see me lose my shit or wilt in the shame. Don\\'t get me wrong, I feel plenty embarrassed, especially in front of my date. But somehow, my contrarian nature kicks in. Just as my friends are ready to rally to my defenses, I stop them.\\n\\n\"Guys, guys. In a few weeks we\\'ll be done with this place. Just forget it.\"\\n\\nNow, make no mistake. I really wanted revenge for the slight. But in that moment, I realized the single most hurtful thing I could possibly do to her...was to ignore her. Make her feel beneath me. Part of *high school*. An insignificant hindrance to a brighter future. Maybe it was the way she was hanging back to relish my comeuppance. In any case, the line came to me, and it was perfect.\\n\\nMy friends all follow me to the dance floor, and we tear it up. At the end of the night, as we\\'re filing out, little Ms. Juicyfruit comes up to me in a bubbling mess. She sobs out an apology, I nod, and my date and I drive off to make out in a quikmart parking lot.',\n",

My bus’ (special needs) wheelchair ramp had a recurring problem with the hydraulic lifting arms. They would get dirt in them and start messing up. Which means my students are now sitting at an angle when being lifted. Or the ramp would simple not go all the way up or down. \\n\\nThey sent the same mechanic from before. We got on another bus to keep up with our route. When we got back before our midday route, I asked him if the ramp was fixed. He responded; in the same know it all voice “yes, you just had to stand on it to get it to go.” \\n\\nI immediately took my bus over to where there was space in the yard and tested the ramp. Watching as the mechanic raced over in his golf cart, as if to prove me wrong. And immediately the ramp messed up again. I looked over; absolutely trying not to be a complete a*shole, telling him “nope, it’s not working right; we’ll go get the other bus”\\n\\nIt was so nice to finally be able to prove I do know what I’m doing and talking about. I’ve since moved to another school district where the mechanics actually listen, and don’t make me feel stupid when I say there’s something wrong. \\nTDRL: mechanic mansplains, I prove I know what I’m talking about and make him looks dumb',\n",

       "  'selftext': ' \\n\\nI remember during my first year of college. I had a friend/roommate who got 82 in an exam and I got 78. The following day our professor started lecturing us and complaining how the class average was low and how the material is dumb and how some students never show up, or show up late or sleep in class. A few day later I was talking to him about how the professor was talking to us and he told me \"I got 82, you got 78, you should be more like me\" and he went on and on in a negative condescending way (note: he skips like half the classes, comes late and sleeps in class).\\n\\nA few days later when I went to check my exam, I noticed there was something off with the grading. Apparently there were mistakes in the marking scheme. This changed the grades of most of the class. The next day the grades were updated. My grade was 82 and his was 78. He told me his grade was 78 and I told him mine was 82. We just looked at each other for a minute and I decided not t to say anything about it (which just annoyed him even more), but we both knew. I\\'ve never seen him so irritated/annoyed and it was the most satisfying revenge by just looking.',\n",
